Biological properties of chitosan could be significantly improved by modification of its chemical structure. This study was aimed at characterizing macroporous hydrogels fabricated by freeze-drying technique from chitosan, which has been N-acetylated by 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid or l,d-lactide. The nature of the acetylated agent was shown to significantly affect hydrogels morphology, swelling behavior, zeta-potential, and protein sorption as well as their degradation by lysozyme. According to scanning electron and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the hydrogels possessed interconnected macroporous network that facilitated cells penetration into the interior regions of the hydrogel. Chemical modification of chitosan significantly influenced L929 cell growth behavior on hydrogel compared to the non-modified chitosan. The proposed chemical strategy for modification of chitosan could be considered as promising approach for improvement of chitosan hydrogels. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Parameters that allow the surface modification without damaging the “macro” structure of scaffolds were determined. Physicochemical properties of the modified scaffolds were described using SEM, EDS, DSC, optical goniometry, and mechanical testing. It was shown that plasma treatment has a significant influence on the scaffolds’ fiber surface relief. The modification process leads to a slight decrease of the scaffold mechanical performance mainly caused by polymer crystallization. Increasing the deposition time increases the amount of titanium on the surface. The biocompatibility of the modified scaffolds was studied using hybridoma of the endothelial cells of human umbilical vein and human lung carcinoma (EA.hy 926 cell line). Cell adhesion, viability, and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin-8 (IL8), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were investigated. It was demonstrated that the deposition of thin titanium coatings on the fibrous scaffolds’ surface enhances cell adhesion.

One of their main advantages is their biodegradation rate that can be modified by changing the proportional ratio of the composition phases. For enhanced bone tissue regeneration, the bioactivity of BCP should be increased by optimizing their physicochemical properties. To date, the ideal physicochemical properties of BCP for bone applications have not been defined. This is mostly related to lack of standard study protocols in biomaterial science especially with regards to their characterizations and clinical applications. In this paper we provided a review on BCP and their physicochemical properties relevant to clinical applications. In addition, we summarized the available literature on their use in animal models and evaluated the influences of different composition ratios on bone healing. Controversies in literature with regards to ideal composition ratio of BCP have also been discussed in detail. We illustrated the discrepancies in study protocols among researchers in animal studies and emphasized the need to develop and follow a set of generally accepted standardized guidelines. Finally; we provided general recommendations for future pre-clinical studies that allow better standardization of study protocols. This will allow better comparison and contrast of newly developed bone substitute biomaterials that help further progress in the field of biomaterial science. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bioceramics; Biphasic calcium phosphates; Bone substitutes; Bone tissue engineering; Pre-clinical study; Study protocol","Animals; Bioceramics; Biodegradation; Bone; Calcium; Calcium phosphate; Phosphates; Standardization; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Tissue regeneration; Biodegradation rate; Biphasic calcium phosphates; Bone substitutes; Bone tissue engineering; Bone tissue regeneration; Clinical application; Physicochemical property; Pre-clinical; Biomaterials",,,09284931,,,,"English",2-s2.0-85006149566

However, manufacture of CS may require thermoresponsive dishes, which increases cost and puts one in dependence on specific materials. Alternative approaches were established recently and we conducted a short study to compare approaches for detachment of CS from c-kit+ CSC. Our in-house developed method using chelation by Versene solution was compared to UpCell™ thermoresponsive plates in terms of CSC proliferation, viability, gap junction formation and engraftment in a model of myocardial infarction. Use of Versene solution instead of thermoresponsive dishes resulted in comparable CS thickness (approximately 100 mcm), cell proliferation rate and no signs of apoptosis detected in both types of constructs. However, we observed a minor reduction of gap junction count in Versene-treated CS. At day 30 after delivery to infarcted myocardium both types of CS retained at the site of transplantation and contained comparable amounts of proliferating cells indicating engraftment. Thus, we may conclude that detachment of CS from c-kit+ CSC using Versene solution followed by mechanical treatment is an alternative to thermoresponsive plates allowing use of routinely available materials to generate constructs for cardiac repair. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cardiac stem cell; Cell sheet; Myocardial infarction; Thermoresponsive dish; Tissue engineering",,"16-15-00181, RSF, Russian Science Foundation","The study was supported by a Russian Science Foundation grant #16-15-00181 (26.01.2016).",00408166,,TICEB,,"English",2-s2.0-85009893925

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of chitosan-based matrices doping with chitin nano-whiskers (CNW) on adhesion, spreading, cytoskeleton structure, and proliferation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). The behavior of BMSCs during culture on chitosan-CNW films was determined by the molecular mass, hydrophobicity, porosity, crosslinking degree, protonation degree and molecular structure of the composite chitosan-CNW films. The shape, spreading area, cytoskeleton structure, and proliferation of BMSCs on chitosan matrices with a crystalline structure and high porosity were similar to that observed for BMSCs cultured on polystyrene tissue culture plates. The amorphous polymer structure and high swelling led to a decrease in the spreading area and cell proliferation. Thus, we can control the behavior of cells in culture (adhesion, spreading, and proliferation) by changing the physico-chemical properties of the chitosan-CNW films. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Adhesion; Bone; Cell engineering; Cell proliferation; Cells; Chitosan; Composite films; Crosslinking; Cytology; Nanowhiskers; Porosity; Rats; Scaffolds (biology); Semiconductor doping; Tissue; Tissue culture; Tissue engineering; Amorphous polymers; Cross-linking degree; Crystalline structure; Nanofiber composites; Physicochemical property; Spatial interaction; Tissue culture plates; Tissue engineering applications; Chitin","16-19-10536, RSF, Russian Science Foundation",,09574530,,JSMME,,"English",2-s2.0-85006990748

Uniform CaCO3 coatings, composed of vaterite microparticles and its aggregates, were formed on PCL fibers by mineral precipitation from solution under ultrasonic treatment. The porous structure of CaCO3 in vaterite polymorphic form is useful for loading of various substances (drugs and nanoparticles), and this property makes vaterite an appropriate material for design of drug delivery systems. Such mineralization was implemented to attain therapeutic and/or biological activity of tissue engineering scaffolds based on electrospun PCL, by means of CaCO3 coatings. Various structures and polymorphs of CaCO3 coatings were obtained by variation of growth conditions (time of fiber incubation in work solution, ultrasonic treatment of this system). Coating homogeneity, CaCO3 polymorphic form, morphology, and CaCO3 mass can be controlled by number of successive stages of fibrous material treatment. Cytotoxicity tests showed that PCL fibers mineralized with CaCO3 did not release substances toxic for cells. SEM images of PCL/CaCO3 scaffolds cultured with cells demonstrate that scaffolds supported cell adhesion and spreading. The presented results show the new technique of controlled PCL scaffold mineralization with vaterite, and an opportunity of using PCL/CaCO3 as scaffolds for tissue engineering. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As for the latter, a well-adjusted stiffness ensures that the biomaterial’s deformation behavior fits well to the deformation behavior of the surrounding biological tissue, whereas an appropriate strength provides sufficient load-carrying capacity of the biomaterial. Here, a mathematical modeling approach for estimating the macroscopic load that initiates failure of a hierarchically organized, granular, hydroxyapatite-based biomaterial is presented. For this purpose, a micromechanics model is developed for downscaling macroscopically prescribed stress (or strain) states to the level of the needle-shaped hydroxyapatite crystals. Presuming that the biomaterial fails due to the quasi-brittle failure of the most unfavorably stressed hydroxyapatite needle, the downscaled stress tensors are fed into a suitable, Mohr-Coulomb-type failure criterion, based on which the macroscopic failure load is deduced. The change of the biomaterial’s composition in response to placing it in physiological solution, caused by growth of new bone tissue on the granules’s surfaces, on the one hand, and by resorption of the hydroxyapatite crystals, on the other hand, is taken into account by means of suitable evolution laws. Numerical studies show how the macroscopic load-carrying capacity of the biomaterial is influenced by its design parameters. The presented modeling approach could prove beneficial for the design process of the studied biomaterials (as well as similarly composed biomaterials), particularly in terms of optimizing its mechanical performance. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bone ingrowth; Continuum micromechanics; Elastic limit; Multiscale modeling; Tissue engineering","Biocompatibility; Biology; Biomechanics; Bone; Composite micromechanics; Deformation; Hydroxyapatite; Large scale systems; Load limits; Loads (forces); Micromechanics; Needles; Physiological models; Physiology; Safety engineering; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Bone ingrowth; Bone tissue engineering; Continuum micromechanics; Elastic limit; Hydroxyapatite crystals; Mechanical performance; Multi-scale Modeling; Physiological environment; Biomaterials","15-13-00108, Russian Science Support Foundation",,03769429,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84991743356

In particular, surgeons have few options when it comes to a long segment reconstruction of the bile duct. Tissue-engineered substitutes, with properties similar to the native tissue, might represent a solution for the functional reconstruction of bile ducts. In particular, decellularized tissues and organs represent a suitable option for tissue engineering when specific scaffolds are needed. However, the optimal conditions to completely remove all the cellular components and minimally affect the structural and residual biochemical properties of the extracellular matrix are still to be found. This paper presents the characterization of rat bile ducts after implementing an established detergent-enzymatic decellularization method. One cycle was enough to generate a complete decellularized bile duct matrix, histologically and structurally similar to the native one. The network of collagen, reticular and elastic fibers, found in the native bile duct matrix was well preserved. Moreover, the decellularization approach did not affect the elastin content. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bile ducts; Decellularization; Detergent-enzymatic approach; Extracellular matrix","Body fluids; Rats; Scaffolds (biology); Tissue; Tissue engineering; Bile ducts; Biochemical properties; Cellular components; Decellularization; Decellularized; Decellularized tissues; Extracellular matrices; Optimal conditions; Ducts",,,21911630,,,,"English",2-s2.0-85000866255

The communication among these nano-devices can be enabled by graphene-based nano-antennas, which generate electromagnetic waves in the Terahertz band. However, from a perspective of the electromagnetic field propagation, human tissues generally introduce high losses that significantly impair the communication process, thus limiting communication ranges. In this context, the aim of this contribution is to study the communication capabilities of a Body Area Nano-NETwork, by carefully taking into account the inhomogeneous and disordered structure offered by biological tissues. To this end, the propagation of Pulsed Electric Fields in a stratified media stack made up by stratum corneum, epidermis, dermis, and fat has been carefully modeled. First, electric and magnetic fields, as well as the Poynting vector, have been calculated through an accurate Finite-Difference Time-Domain dispersive modeling based on the fractional derivative operator. Second, path loss and molecular absorption noise temperature have been evaluated. Finally, channel capacity and the related transmission ranges have been estimated by using some baseline physical interfaces. Moreover, the comparison with respect to reference values already available in the literature is presented too. Obtained results clearly highlight that new research efforts are needed to ensure the considered communications due to the severe impairment suffered by electromagnetic waves. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Body Area Nano-NETworks; Channel capacity; Finite-difference time-domain; Fractional calculus; Nanoscale communications; Propagation models; Pulsed electric fields","Calculations; Channel capacity; Circular waveguides; Diagnosis; Electric fields; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic waves; Finite difference time domain method; Graphene; Histology; Medical information systems; Nanoantennas; Terahertz waves; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Fractional calculus; Nano-networks; Nanoscale communications; Propagation models; Pulsed electric field; Electromagnetic field effects",,,18787789,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84999711606

However, it was shown that PHBV/PCL grafts require biofunctionalization to achieve high primary patency rate. Here we compared immobilization of arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD)-containing peptides and the incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as two widely established biofunctionalization approaches. Electrospun PHBV/PCL small-diameter grafts with either RGD peptides or VEGF, as well as unmodified grafts were implanted into rat abdominal aortas for 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following histological and immunofluorescence assessment. We detected CD31+/CD34+/vWF+ cells 1 and 3 months postimplantation at the luminal surface of PHBV/PCL/RGD and PHBV/PCL/VEGF, but not in unmodified grafts, with the further observation of CD31+ CD34 − vWF+ phenotype. These cells were considered as endothelial and produced a collagen-positive layer resembling a basement membrane. Detection of CD31+/CD34+ cells at the early stages with subsequent loss of CD34 indicated cell adhesion from the bloodstream. Therefore, either conjugation with RGD peptides or the incorporation of VEGF promoted the formation of a functional endothelial cell layer. Furthermore, both modifications increased primary patency rate three-fold. In conclusion, both of these biofunctionalization approaches can be considered as equally efficient for the modification of tissue-engineered vascular grafts. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Endothelialization; RGD peptides; Tissue engineering; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Vascular graft",,"14-25-00050, RSF, Russian Science Foundation","This investigation was performed in the Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases owing to the funding of Russian Science Foundation (project No. 14-25-00050).",16616596,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84995948262

The spin-coating technique allows rapid fabrication of pNIPAm substrates with high reproducibility and uniformity. In this study, the dynamics of cell attachment, proliferation, and function on non-cross-linked spin-coated pNIPAm films of different thicknesses were investigated. The measurements of advancing contact angle revealed increasing contact angles with increasing film thickness. Results suggest that more hydrophilic 50 and 80 nm thin pNIPAm films are more preferable for cell sheet fabrication, whereas more hydrophobic 300 and 900 nm thick spin-coated pNIPAm films impede cell attachment. These changes in cell behavior were correlated with changes in thickness and hydration of pNIPAm films.

Modification of such structures allows manipulating with biological and immune response. Previously, our team suggested a number of surface modification strategies for thin films made of PLLA. One of the proposed strategies are based on treatment of the material with ""solvent/non-solvent"" mixture that allows absorbing biologically active molecules or linkers on the surface of the sample. The aim of this work was to compare the influence of ""solvent/non-solvent"" treatment on the structure and crystallinity of the elecrospun biodegradable PCL and PLLA scaffolds. For that purpose, original PCL and PLLA scaffolds were treated with mixture of toluene and ethanol in different proportions. Morphology of the obtained samples was studied using scanning electron microscopy. It was shown that ""solvent/non-solvent"" treatment doesn't lead to changes in scaffolds morphology such as gluing or cutting of the matrix fibers. By means of X-ray diffraction analysis it was shown that treatment of the samples with selected mixtures doesn't change material crystallinity. Thus, it was demonstrated that proposed composition of the ""solvent/nonsolvent"" mixture can be used for the modification of electrospun PCL and PLLA scaffolds. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2016.",,"Lactic acid; Mixtures; Molecules; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; Surface treatment; X ray diffraction analysis; Biodegradable scaffold; Biologically active molecules; Different proportions; Drug delivery system; Fibrous structures; Poly L lactic acid; Regenerative medicine; Signal molecules; Scaffolds",,,2261236X,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84992670267

The inner porous layer of the scaffold produced from silk fibroin was designed to promote cell proliferation and the outer layer produced from poly-l-lactic acid to serve as a waterproof barrier. To compare the feasibility and efficacy of BMSC application in the reconstruction of bladder defects, 12 adult male rabbits were divided into experimental and control groups (six animals each) that received a scaffold seeded with BMSCs or an acellular one, respectively. For BMSC tracking in the graft in in vivo studies using magnetic resonance imaging, cells were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. In vitro studies demonstrated high intracellular incorporation of nanoparticles and the absence of a toxic influence on BMSC viability and proliferation. Following implantation of the graft with BMSCs into the bladder, we observed integration of the scaffold with surrounding bladder tissues (as detected by magnetic resonance imaging). During the follow-up period of 12 weeks, labeled BMSCs resided in the implanted scaffold. The functional activity of the reconstructed bladder was confirmed by electromyography. Subsequent histological assay demonstrated enhanced biointegrative properties of the PL-SF scaffold with cells in comparison to the control graft, as related to complete regeneration of the smooth muscle and urothelium tissues in the implant. Confocal microscopy studies confirmed the presence of the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle-labeled BMSCs in newly formed bladder layers, thus indicating the role of stem cells in bladder regeneration.

If applied in cooperation with clinical methods it provides optimization of diagnosis and treatment procedures. This technique turns biological tissues more transparent through two main mechanisms - tissue dehydration and refractive index (RI) matching between tissue components. Such matching is obtained by partial replacement of interstitial water by a biocompatible agent that presents higher RI and it can be completely reversible by natural rehydration in vivo or by assisted rehydration in ex vivo tissues. Experimental data to characterize and discriminate between the two mechanisms and to find new ones are necessary. Using a simple method, based on collimated transmittance and thickness measurements made from muscle samples under treatment, we have estimated the diffusion properties of glucose, ethylene glycol (EG) and water that were used to perform such characterization and discrimination. Comparing these properties with data from literature that characterize their diffusion in water we have observed that muscle cell membrane permeability limits agent and water diffusion in the muscle. The same experimental data has allowed to calculate the optical clearing (OC) efficiency and make an interpretation of the internal changes that occurred in muscle during the treatments. The same methodology can now be used to perform similar studies with other agents and in other tissues in order to solve engineering problems at design of inexpensive and robust technologies for a considerable improvement of optical tomographic techniques with better contrast and in-depth imaging. © 2016 The Author(s).","agent diffusivity; Collimated transmittance; ethylene glycol; glucose; refractive index matching; thickness variation; tissue dehydration","Biocompatibility; Cytology; Dehydration; Diffusion; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Glucose; Histology; Muscle; Polyols; Refractive index; Thickness measurement; Collimated transmittance; Diffusion properties; Engineering problems; Interstitial water; Partial replacement; Refractive index matching; Thickness variation; Tomographic techniques; Tissue; ethylene glycol; glucose; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell membrane permeability; dehydration; diffusion; immersion; light scattering; muscle fiber membrane; muscle metabolism; muscle thickness; nonhuman; optical immersion clearing; optical tomography; rat; refraction index; rehydration; skeletal muscle; tissue dehydration",,,17935458,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84978760254

Restoring microanatomy and function using stem cells is a promising therapeutic approach. Among the many various sources, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are one of the most easily harvested alternatives, they multiply rapidly, and they demonstrate low immunogenicity with an ability to differentiate into several cell types. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of xenotransplanted human ADSCs on post-traumatic regeneration of rat sciatic nerve. Peripheral reconstruction following complete sciatic transection and autonerve grafting was complemented by intra-operative injection of hADSCs into the proximal and distal stumps. The injury caused gliosis and apoptosis of sensory neurons in the lumbar 5 (L5) ganglia in the control rodents; however, animals treated with hADSCs demonstrated a smaller amount of cellular loss. Formation of amputation neuroma, which hinders axonal repair, was less prominent in the experimental group, and immunohistochemical analysis of myelin basic protein showed good myelination 65 days after surgery. At this point, control groups still exhibited high levels of microglia/macrophage-specific marker Iba-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the mark of an ongoing inflammation and incomplete axonal growth 2 months after the injury. This report demonstrates that hADSCs promote neuronal survival in the spinal ganglion, fuel axonal repair and stimulate the regeneration of peripheral nerves. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.","Autonerve graft; Human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC); Peripheral nerve injury; Regenerative medicine; Repair; Xenotransplantation","adipose tissue; animal; confocal microscopy; disease model; fluorescence microscopy; human; immunohistochemistry; injuries; nerve regeneration; pathology; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; physiology; rat; sciatic nerve; spinal ganglion; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; treatment outcome; xenograft; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Ganglia, Spinal; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Nerve Regeneration; Peripheral Nerve Injuries; Rats; Sciatic Nerve; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells; Transplantation, Heterologous; Treatment Outcome",,,15918890,,CEMLB,26047869,"English",2-s2.0-84930531544

The primary reason for this is delayed diagnosis via blood examination, urine analysis, tissue biopsy, or ultrasound and X-ray computed tomography imaging. Blood, urine, and tissue-based diagnoses can be time consuming, while ultrasound and CT imaging have relatively low spatial resolution, with reduced sensitivity. Optical coherence tomography is a noninvasive and high-resolution imaging technique that provides superior spatial resolution (micrometer scale) as compared to ultrasound and CT. Changes in tissue properties can be detected based on the optical metrics analyzed from the OCT signals, such as optical attenuation and speckle variance. Furthermore, OCT does not rely on ionizing radiation as with CT imaging. In addition to structural changes, the elasticity of the kidney can significantly change due to nephritis. In this work, OCT has been utilized to quantify the difference in tissue properties between healthy and nephritic murine kidneys. Although OCT imaging could identify the diseased tissue, its classification accuracy is clinically inadequate. By combining optical metrics with elasticity, the classification accuracy improves from 76% to 95%. These results show that OCT combined with OCE can be a powerful tool for identifying and classifying nephritis. Therefore, the OCT/OCE method could potentially be used as a minimally invasive tool for longitudinal studies during the progression and therapy of glomerulonephritis as well as complement and, perhaps, substitute highly invasive tissue biopsies.

The landscape of software that is easily available to do such work is limited and lacks essential features necessary for combining elastic matter with simulations of liquids. Here we present an open source software package called Sibernetic, designed for the physical simulation of biomechanical matter (membranes, elastic matter, contractile matter) and environments (liquids, solids and elastic matter with variable physical properties). At its core, Sibernetic is built as an extension to Predictive-Corrective Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (PCISPH). Sibernetic is built on top of OpenCL, making it possible to run simulations on CPUs or GPUs, and has 3D visualization support built on top of OpenGL. Several test examples of the software running and reproducing physical experiments, as well as performance benchmarks, are presented and future directions are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we describe an additional mechanism by which uPA regulates angiogenesis. Ex vivo VEGF-induced vascular sprouting from Matrigel-embedded aortic rings isolated from uPA knock-out (uPA-/-) mice was impaired compared with vessels emanating from wild-type mice. Endothelial cells isolated from uPA-/- mice show less proliferation and migration in response to VEGF than their wild type counterparts or uPA-/- endothelial cells in which expression of wild type uPA had been restored. We reported previously that uPA is transported from cell surface receptors to nuclei through a mechanism that requires its kringle domain. Intranuclear uPA modulates gene transcription by binding to a subset of transcription factors. Here we report that wild type single-chain uPA, but not uPA variants incapable of nuclear transport, increases the expression of cell surface VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by translocating to the nuclei of ECs. Intranuclear single-chain uPA binds directly to and interferes with the function of the transcription factor hematopoietically expressed homeodomain protein or proline-rich homeodomain protein (HHEX/ PRH), which thereby lose their physiologic capacity to repress the activity of vehgr1 and vegfr2 gene promoters. These studies identify uPA-dependent de-repression of vegfr1 and vegfr2 gene transcription through binding to HHEX/PRH as a novel mechanism by which uPA mediates the pro-angiogenic effects of VEGF and identifies a potential new target for control of pathologic angiogenesis. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Bins; Cell engineering; Cell membranes; Cell signaling; Cells; Chains; Cytology; Endothelial cells; Enzyme activity; Genes; Mammals; Proteins; Transcription factors; Cell surface receptors; Extracellular matrices; Homeodomain proteins; Intracellular signaling; Proteolytic degradation; Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA); Vascular endothelial growth factor; Vascular permeability; Transcription; proline rich protein; urokinase; vasculotropin; vasculotropin receptor 1; vasculotropin receptor 2; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cell migration; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; controlled study; endothelium cell; ex vivo study; gene; gene repression; gene translocation; genetic transcription; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; protein localization; signal transduction; vefgr2 gene; vehgr1 gene; wild type","13-04-02014-a16-04-01699, RFBR, Russian Foundation for Basic Research; HL116916 ,CA141228R21-AI-102177, NIH, National Institutes of Health","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants HL116916 (to D.

Tissue structures and the corresponding models showing linear and circular birefringence, dichroism, and chirality are analyzed. As the basis for a quantitative description of the interaction of polarized light with tissues, the theory of polarization transfer in a random medium is used. This theory employs the modified transfer equation for Stokes parameters to predict the polarization properties of single- and multiple-scattered optical fields. The near-order of scatterers in tissues is accounted for to provide an adequate description of tissue polarization properties. Biomedical diagnostic techniques based on polarized light detection, including polarization imaging and spectroscopy, amplitude and intensity light scattering matrix measurements, and polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography are described. Examples of biomedical applications of these techniques for early diagnostics of cataracts, detection of precancer, and prediction of skin disease are presented. The substantial reduction of light scattering multiplicity at tissue optical clearing that leads to a lesser influence of scattering on the measured intrinsic polarization properties of the tissue and allows for more precise quantification of these properties is demonstrated. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","biomedical optics; birefringence; medical imaging; optical properties; polarization; tissues","Birefringence; Coherent scattering; Diagnosis; Histology; Light; Light polarization; Light scattering; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Optical properties; Optical tomography; Polarization; Spectroscopy; Tissue; Bio medical diagnostics; Biomedical applications; Biomedical optics; Polarization optical method; Polarization properties; Polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography; Quantitative description; Tissue optical clearings; Tissue engineering",,,10833668,,JBOPF,,"English",2-s2.0-84969181219

These cells display similar cell surface characteristics based on their fibroblastic nature, but also exhibit differences in molecular phenotype, growth rate, and their ability to differentiate into various cell phenotypes. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain poorly understood. We analyzed Ca2+ signals and membrane properties in rat adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in basal conditions, and then following a switch into medium that contains factors known to modify their character. Modified ADSCs (mADSCs) expressed L-type Ca2+ channels whereas both L- and P/Q- channels were operational in mBMSCs. Both mADSCs and mBMSCs possessed functional endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, expressed ryanodine receptor-1 and -3, and exhibited spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. The mBMSCs expressed P2X7 purinoceptors; the mADSCs expressed both P2X (but not P2X7) and P2Y (but not P2Y1) receptors. Both types of stromal cells exhibited [Ca2+]i responses to vasopressin (AVP) and expressed V1 type receptors. Functional oxytocin (OT) receptors were, in contrast, expressed only in modified ADSCs and BMSCs. AVP and OT-induced [Ca2+]i responses were dose-dependent and were blocked by their respective specific receptor antagonists. Electrophysiological data revealed that passive ion currents dominated the membrane conductance in ADSCs and BMSCs. Medium modification led to a significant shift in the reversal potential of passive currents from -40 to -50 mV in cells in basal to -80 mV in modified cells. Hence membrane conductance was mediated by non-selective channels in cells in basal conditions, whereas in modified medium conditions, it was associated with K+-selective channels. Our results indicate that modification of ADSCs and BMSCs by alteration in medium formulation is associated with significant changes in their Ca2+ signaling and membrane properties. © 2015 The Authors.","Adipose derived stromal cells; Bone marrow stromal cell; Ca2+ signaling; Ion channels; Ionotropic receptors; Oxytocin; Patch-clamp; Purinergic signaling; Ryanodine receptors; Vasopressin","adenosine triphosphate; calcium; glutamate receptor; ion channel; ionotropic receptor; oxytocin; potassium channel; purinergic P2 receptor; ryanodine receptor 1; ryanodine receptor 3; adipose derived stem cell; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; bone marrow stroma cell; calcium signaling; cell membrane depolarization; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum; extracellular calcium; gene expression; immunocytochemistry; ion current; membrane conductance; membrane steady potential; nonhuman; oscillation; phenotype; priority journal; rat; regenerative medicine; reversal potential; tissue engineering","GACR 10504P, GACR, Grant Agency of the Czech Republic; GACR 14-34077S, GACR, Grant Agency of the Czech Republic; GACR P304/11/2373, GACR, Grant Agency of the Czech Republic; GACR P304/12/G069, GACR, Grant Agency of the Czech Republic","This work was supported by the grants GACR 14-34077S, GACR P304/11/2373, GACR P304/12/G069 and GACR 10504P from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.

Since none of the known individual types of CaPO4 appears to be able to mimic both the composition and the properties of natural bones, various attempts have been sought to overcome this problem and a multiphasic (polyphasic) concept is one of the reasonable solutions. In general, this approach is determined by advantageous formulations consisting of homogeneous blends of two (biphasic), three (triphasic) or more (multiphasic) individual CaPO4 phases possessing diverse solubility and, therefore, bioresorbability, while the optimum ratios among the phases depend on the definite applications. Therefore, all currently known multiphasic CaPO4 formulations are sparingly soluble in water and, thus, after being implanted they are gradually resorbed inside the body, releasing calcium and orthophosphate ions into the biological medium and, hence, seeding a new bone formation. They have already demonstrated a proven biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, safety and predictability in vitro, in vivo, as well as in clinical trials. More recently, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that some of them might possess osteoinductive properties. Hence, in tissue engineering, multiphasic CaPO4 bioceramics represent promising formulations to construct various scaffolds capable of carrying and/or modulating the behavior of cells. This review summarizes the available information on biphasic, triphasic and multiphasic CaPO4 bioceramics including their biomedical applications.

Fibrinogen was covalently linked with PEG-NHS in order to improve its degradability resistance and physico-optical properties. We have studied influences of the degree of protein PEGylation and the concentration of enzyme thrombin used for the gel preparation on cellular responses. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of prepared gels revealed that the degree of PEGylation and the concentration of thrombin strongly influenced microstructural characteristics of the protein hydrogel. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), used as vasculogenic co-culture, could grow in 5:1 PEGylated fibrin gels prepared using 1:0.2 protein to thrombin ratio. This gel formulation supported hASCs and HUVECs spreading and the formation of cell extensions and cell-to-cell contacts. Expression of specific ECM proteins and vasculogenic process inherent cellular enzymatic activity were investigated by immunofluorescent staining, gelatin zymography, western blot and RT-PCR analysis. After evaluation of the optimal gel composition and PEGylation ratio, the hydrogel was utilized for investigation of vascular tube formation within a perfusable microfluidic system. The morphological development of this co-culture within a perfused hydrogel over 12 days led to the formation of interconnected HUVEC-hASC network. The demonstrated PEGylated fibrin microfluidic approach can be used for incorporating other cell types, thus representing a unique experimental platform for basic vascular tissue engineering and drug screening applications. © 2016 by De Gruyter.","microfluidic hydrogels; PEGylated fibrin; tissue engineering; vasculogenesis","fibrin; fibrinogen; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; macrogol; matrix metalloproteinase 14; matrix metalloproteinase 16; matrix metalloproteinase 19; silicone; thrombin; adipose derived stem cell; angiogenesis; Article; cell encapsulation; chemical composition; chemical modification; coculture; concentration (parameters); confocal microscopy; controlled study; covalent bond; human; human cell; hydrogel; immunofluorescence test; infrared spectroscopy; microfluidics; PEGylation; priority journal; protein expression; protein modification; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; scanning electron microscopy; tissue engineering; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular tissue; Western blotting; zymography","DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Daria Guseva (MHH) for the assistance in confocal microscopy imaging.

Therefore we suggest that the matrix metalloproteinases levels are more important diagnostic indicators in patients with dilation than the TIMP-1 level itself. Furthermore, significant cross-correlations between the echocardiographic indices and the indices of collagenolysis system have been observed and quantified by linear regression analysis.

The main elements of the device are a laser guidance system and an adaptive thermal stabilization system. The laser solder is based on a water−albumin dispersion of single-layer carbon nanotubes (SCNTs). The properties of the SCNTs were tested using scanning electron microscopy. The surface of the weld was found to have cracks up to 10 μm in width and 150 μm in length. The cracks contained SCNT bundles <50 nm in diameter, which provided coagulation-induced sealing of the nanocomposite onto the biological tissue, thus strengthening the wound edges. Data on the welding contact temperature maintained during laser welding, the exposure time, and the corresponding weld rupture strength were obtained. The optimal weld temperature at maximal weld strength was 50-55Â°C. At this temperature, use of point laser welding made it possible to avoid thermal necrosis of surrounding healthy biological tissue and to obtain a welding nanocomposite with sufficient bonding strength.

Recently, microfabrication strategies in combination with other chemistries have been utilized to capture the architectural complexity of intricate organs, such as the liver, in in vitro platforms. Here it is shown that a biofunctionalized poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel scaffold, fabricated using a sphere-template, facilitates hepatic sheet formation that follows the microscale patterns of the scaffold surface. The design takes advantage of the excellent diffusion properties of porous, uniform 3D hydrogel platforms, and the enhanced-cell-extracellular matrix interaction with the display of conjugated collagen type I, which in turn elicits favorable Huh-7.5 response. Collectively, the experimental findings and corresponding simulations demonstrate the importance of biofunctionalized porous scaffolds and indicate that the microscaffold shows promise in liver tissue engineering applications and provides distinct advantages over current cell sheet and hepatocyte spheroid technologies. Spheroid hepatocyte culture, as found in sphere-templated nonfouling microscaffolds, poses the risk of cell necrosis at the hepatosphere core.

The traditional way to identify the main absorption and scattering characteristics of semi-transparent materials is based on spectral measurements of normal-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance for the material sample. Unfortunately this way cannot be used in the case of in vivo measurements of optical properties of biological tissues. A method suggested in the present paper is based on thermal response to the periodic radiative heating of the open surface of a semi-transparent material. It is shown that the period of a variation of the surface temperature is sensitive to the value of an average absorption coefficient in the surface layer. As a result, the monochromatic external irradiation combined with the surface temperature measurements can be used to retrieve the spectral values of absorption coefficient. Possible application of this method to porous semi-transparent ceramics is considered. An example problem is also solved to illustrate the applicability of this method to human skin. The approach suggested enables one to estimate an average absorption coefficient of human skin of a patient just before the thermal processing. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Absorption; Biomedical applications; Identification; Radiative-conductive heat transfer; Scattering; Solar engineering","Absorption; Atmospheric temperature; Heat transfer; Identification (control systems); Medical applications; Optical properties; Scattering; Surface properties; Temperature measurement; Absorption and scatterings; Average absorption coefficients; Biomedical applications; Optical properties of biological tissues; Radiative-conductive heat transfer; Semi-transparent materials; Solar engineering; Surface temperature measurement; Tissue; absorption coefficient; heat transfer; heating; light scattering; optical property; radiative transfer",,,00224073,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84956815385

In this study, the authors resort to quantitative engineering principles to assess the fracture safety of double-porous hydroxyapatite ceramics: micro-computed tomography scans give access to the morphology of macropores at the submillimeter scale, as well as to voxel-specific microporosities. Advanced micromechanics of porous ceramics with needle-shaped elementary units then allows for translating voxel-specific microporosities to corresponding elasticity and strength properties, as well as to macro-to-micro scale transition (‘concentration’) tensors. These mechanical properties and tensors are fed into a large-scale finite-element model of a biomaterial granule as used for mandibular tissue regeneration. Loading the granule in splitting mode, up to physiological strain, evidences stress concentrations at the loaded poles and close to internal macropores and cracks. A parallel computing-supported subvoxel analysis of needle orientations evidences that in highly loaded regions, the intravoxel ‘single crystals’ oriented perpendicular to the loading direction undergo the most unfavorable loading. Still, only 0·6% of the finiteelements show stresses indicating failure, and the mean safety factor against fracture is as high as 7. This analysis confirms, from an engineering science viewpoint, the successful use of the investigated biomaterials in clinical practice. © 2016, ICE Publishing.

However, there is a need to develop strategies to produce collagen three dimensional structures with mechanical properties suitable for proper handling and manipulation. In this regard, we report here a self-assembled GO-collagen (GO-Col) scaffold with a porous network resulting from preferential interaction of oxygen functional groups located on the GO nanosheet edges with amine groups on the biopolymer chain. The accurate control of such conjugation, which is dependent on both the pH of the medium and the collagen/GO weight ratio used during the synthesis, allows the repulsion and bonding forces within the GO-Col nanocomposite system to be to minutely modulated and consequently also provides the opportunity to fabricate a wide range of stable GO-Col scaffolds. Results concerning the stability in physiological medium under mechanical stimulation and the cytocompatibility of the most viable GO-Col scaffold in terms of mechanical integrity and its reduced counterpart indicated that these novel scaffolds provide a useful new approach for the assembly of suitable cellular microenvironments that could be explored in tissue engineering applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Collagen; Control system synthesis; Graphene; Nanocomposites; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Collagen-based scaffolds; Mechanical integrity; Mechanical stimulation; Nanocomposite systems; Oxygen functional groups; Preferential interaction; Three-dimensional structure; Tissue engineering applications; Scaffolds (biology)","IF/00917/2013, FCT, Fuel Cycle Technologies; IF/00917/2013/CP1162/CT0016, FCT, Fuel Cycle Technologies; SFRH/BDP/84419/2012, FCT, Fuel Cycle Technologies; SFRH/BPD/90562/2012, FCT, Fuel Cycle Technologies; NIHR, National Institute for Health Research","PAAP Marques thank the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for the investigator grant (IF/00917/2013) and for the project IF/00917/2013/CP1162/CT0016 which supports the researcher grant of Andr Giro.

In vitro tests were done using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated from mature bone marrow of CBA/j inbred mice, and cultured in 3 different culture media - Control medium, Osteogenic medium, and Chondrogenic medium. Hepatocytes and islet cells were isolated from the livers and pancreatic glands of Wistar rats respectively, seeded on porous TiNi-based SMA scaffolds, and cultured. The scaffolds were then implanted into the abdominal cavity of Wistar rats and later harvested, at days 7, 14, 21, and 28, post-implantation. SEM imaging was performed with pre-implanted scaffolds at day 0 and harvested scaffolds at days 7, 14, 21, and 28, post-implantation.

Today, oncology and oncosurgery are considered as the most promising fields of its application. It is known that cancerous tissues are able to accumulate different porphyrins, both endogenous and exogenous, in enhanced amount due to increased metabolism in cancerous cells. So, LFS can be used in vivo for detection of malignant tumours as well as for real-time intraoperative imaging or diagnostics at a photodynamic therapy. One of the reason of the enhanced accumulation of porphyrins in tissues is a chronic hypoxia. Therefore, it was hypothesized, that LFS could also be used for diagnosis of local inflammation in tissues. Recently, some indirect data confirming the hypothesis was obtained when observed inflammation due to invasion of external substances into tissues. This study proves the hypothesis in a direct experiment with animals and laboratory tests. Enhanced fluorescence intensity of the exogenous photosensitizer was found in inflamed tissues. The direct association between intensity of the fluorescence, histological characteristics and blood test results was shown. It was found that the registered fluorescence signal correlates with neutrophil counts in blood of tested animals.

Thus, an accurate and early diagnosis is critical for preserving renal function. Currently, blood, urine, and tissue-based diagnoses can be time consuming, while ultrasound and CT imaging have relatively low spatial resolution. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that provides superior spatial resolution (micron scale) as compared to ultrasound and CT. Pathological changes in tissue properties can be detected based on the optical metrics analyzed from the OCT signal, such as optical attenuation and speckle variance. Moreover, OCT does not rely on ionizing radiation as with CT imaging. In addition to structural changes, the elasticity of the kidney can significantly change due to nephritis. In this work, we utilized OCT to detect the difference in tissue properties between healthy and nephritic murine kidneys. Although OCT imaging could identify the diseased tissue, classification accuracy using only optical metrics was clinically inadequate. By combining optical metrics with elasticity, the classification accuracy improved from 76% to 95%. These results show that OCT combined with OCE can be potentially useful for nephritis detection. © 2016 SPIE.","elastic wave velocity; elasticity optical coherence elastography; glomerulonephritis; optical attenuation; speckle variance; Young's modulus","Biomechanics; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Elastic moduli; Elastic waves; Elasticity; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Image resolution; Imaging techniques; Ionizing radiation; Medical imaging; Optical tomography; Speckle; Tissue; Tomography; Ultrasonic applications; Wave propagation; Elastic wave velocity; glomerulonephritis; Optical attenuation; Optical coherence elastography; Speckle variances; Tissue engineering","R01 DK81872, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R01 EY022362, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R01 HL120140, NIH, National Institutes of Health; U54 HG006348, NIH, National Institutes of Health","This work was supported in part by NIH R01 DK81872 (C.M) and R01 EY022362, R01 HL120140, and U54 HG006348 (K.L).

Low-amplitude (micrometer scale) elastic waves were induced by a focused air-pulse delivery system and imaged by the respective systems. The Young's modulus as assessed by both elastographic techniques was similar and was compared to the stiffness as measured by uniaxial mechanical testing. The results show that both techniques accurately quantified the elasticity. OCE can provide absolute elastic wave temporal profile, depth-resolved measurement and superior displacement sensitivity compared to LMV, but LMV is significantly cheaper (10X) and easier to implement than OCE. © 2016 SPIE.","air-pulse; elastic wave; elasticity; laser Michelson interferometric vibrometer; non-contact; optical coherence elastography; optical coherence tomography","Biomechanics; Elastic moduli; Elastic waves; Elasticity; Mechanical testing; Medical imaging; Optical tomography; Tissue; Vibration measurement; Biomedical properties; Comparison study; Delivery systems; Michelson; Micrometer scale; Non-contact; Optical coherence elastography; Temporal profile; Tissue engineering","1R01EY022362, NIH, National Institutes of Health; 1R01HL120140, NIH, National Institutes of Health; U54HG006348, NIH, National Institutes of Health","This work was supported, in part, by grants 1R01EY022362, 1R01HL120140, and U54HG006348 from the NIH and PRJ71TN from DOD/NAVSEA.",16057422,9781628419443,,,"English",2-s2.0-84978765425

Strategies consisting of bioengineered dressings and cell-based products have emerged for widespread clinical use; however, their performance is not optimal because chronic wounds persist as a serious unmet medical need. Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex that adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes, is responsible for telomere maintenance, and its expression is associated with cell immortalization and, in certain cases, cancerogenesis. Telomerase contains a catalytic subunit, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Introduction of TERT into human cells extends both their lifespan and their telomeres to lengths typical of young cells. The regulation of TERT involves transcriptional and posttranscriptional molecular biology mechanisms. The manipulation, regulation of telomerase is multifactorial in mammalian cells, involving overall telomerase gene expression, post-translational protein-protein interactions, and protein phosphorylation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in aging, apoptosis, and necrosis of cells in numerous diseases. Upon production of high levels of ROS from exogenous or endogenous generators, the redox balance is perturbed and cells are shifted into a state of oxidative stress, which subsequently leads to modifications of intracellular proteins and membrane lipid peroxidation and to direct DNA damage. When the oxidative stress is severe, survival of the cell is dependent on the repair or replacement of damaged molecules, which can result in induction of apoptosis in the injured with ROS cells. ROS-mediated oxidative stress induces the depletion of hTERT from the nucleus via export through the nuclear pores. Nuclear export is initiated by ROS-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 707 within hTERT by the Src kinase family. It might be presumed that protection of mitochondria against oxidative stress is an important telomere length-independent function for telomerase in cell survival. Biotechnology companies are focused on development of therapeutic telomerase vaccines, telomerase inhibitors, and telomerase promoter-driven cell killing in oncology, have a telomerase antagonist in late preclinical studies. Anti-aging medicine-oriented groups have intervened on the market with products working on telomerase activation for a broad range of degenerative diseases in which replicative senescence or telomere dysfunction may play an important role. Since oxidative damage has been shown to shorten telomeres in tissue culture models, the adequate topical, transdermal, or systemic administration of antioxidants (such as, patented ocular administration of 1% N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye drops in the treatment of cataracts) may be beneficial at preserving telomere lengths and delaying the onset or in treatment of disease in susceptible individuals.

Regenerative medicine with cell-based technologies as its integral part is focused on the structural and functional restoration of tissues impaired by sickness or aging. Unlike drug-based medicine directed primarily at alleviation of symptoms, regenerative medicine offers a more holistic approach to disease and senescence management aimed to achieve restoration of homeostasis. Hepatocyte transplantation and organ engineering are very probable forthcoming options of liver disease treatment in people of different ages and vigorous research and technological innovations in this area are in progress. Accordingly, availability of sufficient amounts of functional human hepatocytes is crucial. Direct isolation of autologous hepatocytes from liver biopsy is problematic due to related discomfort and difficulties with further expansion of cells, particularly those derived from aging people. Allogeneic primary human hepatocytes meeting quality standards are also in short supply. Alternatively, autologous hepatocytes can be produced by reprogramming of differentiated cells through the stage of induced pluripotent stem cells. In addition, fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells can be directly induced to undergo advanced stage hepatogenic differentiation. Reprogramming of cells derived from elderly people is accompanied by the reversal of age-associated changes at the cellular level manifesting itself by telomere elongation and the U-turn of DNA methylation. Cell reprogramming can provide high quality rejuvenated hepatocytes for cell therapy and liver tissue engineering. Further technological advancements and establishment of national and global registries of induced pluripotent stem cell lines homozygous for HLA haplotypes can allow industry-style production of livers for immunosuppression-free transplantation. © 2015 Yarygin et al.","Cell aging; Liver cell therapy; Liver engineering; Rejuvenation","age; aging; cell differentiation; cell expansion; cell therapy; cell transdifferentiation; cell transplantation; DNA methylation; holistic care; human; liver biopsy; liver cell; liver disease; mesenchymal stem cell; pluripotent stem cell; regenerative medicine; Review; skin fibroblast; tissue engineering; age; biological therapy; cell reprogramming technique; fibroblast; induced pluripotent stem cell; Liver Diseases; liver regeneration; mesenchymal stroma cell; metabolism; physiology; procedures; telomere homeostasis; activin; activin A; Nodal signaling protein; Wnt protein; Activins; Age Factors; Aging; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Cellular Reprogramming Techniques; DNA Methylation; Fibroblasts; Hepatocytes; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Liver Diseases; Liver Regeneration; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Nodal Signaling Ligands; Telomere Homeostasis; Tissue Engineering; Wnt Proteins",,,11769092,,,26664104,"English",2-s2.0-84949812891

Data on changes in the expression of myogenic regulatory factors in gingiva derived MSCs can serve as confirmation of the possibility of differentiation of these cells into the myogenic direction. The study was conducted on cultures of gingiva derived MSCs and skin fibroblasts. When comparing gene expression profiles of gingiva derived MSCs and skin fibroblasts significant changes have been registered for 153 genes. Of these, we selected 19 significant differentially expressed genes, for which main signal pathways were analyzed. Evidences of significant activation/inactivation of signaling pathways and key genes that have been identified for the population of human satellite cells were obtained during analysis of the genome transcriptome profiles of gingiva derived MSCs. This applies to such signaling pathways as the p38 MAPK, NOTCH and other groups responsible for the proliferation and differentiation in myogenic direction, the processes of self-renewal or self-maintenance in the population of satellite cells. At the same time full match in the patterns of gene expression between the stable population of gingiva derived MSCs and human satellite cells undergoing myogenic differentiation as well as cells derived from atypical sources and differentiated in the myogenic direction was not observed. The data of our experiment suggests that the gingiva derived MSCs are distinct from satellite cells and could be considered as population with plateaued development, possessing the ability to differentiate into myogenic direction due to non-canonical expression pattern of myogenic regulatory factors.","CustomArray 12K; Genes expression profile; Gingiva; Gingiva derived mesenchymal stromal cells; Microarray; Myogenic differentiation; Regenerative medicine","mitogen activated protein kinase; myogenic factor; Notch receptor; synaptophysin; Article; cell differentiation; cell population; cell proliferation; gene expression; gingiva; human; human cell; mesenchymal stroma cell; signal transduction; skin fibroblast; stem cell culture; stem cell self-renewal; transcriptomics",,,23131829,,,,"Russian",2-s2.0-84962255054

Still, efficacy of these methods has been shown to be below expectations due to the fact that injection procedures used to transplant cells can diminish their survival rate. To circumvent this problem a technique known as ""cell sheets"" can be utilized. Cell sheets are minimal tissue-engineered constructs that comprise of cells along with their extracellular matrix proteins. Present study investigates application of cell sheets from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSC) to stimulate angiogenesis. In a mouse model of limb ischemia we demonstrate that subcutaneous implantation of a cell sheet from 1 mln AD-MSC effectively stimulates angiogenesis and restores perfusion of ischemic muscle compared to untreated animals with limb ischemia. Histology also indicates that cell sheet transplantation results in decreased necrosis of skeletal muscle and retain of AD-MSC at Day 14 with certain prevalence of proliferating and minimal amount of apoptotic cells within cell sheet. Furthermore, comparison of cell sheet-treated animals vs. injection of the same dose of AD-MSC shows that cell sheet delivery was superior to routine injection-based delivery in terms of limb perfusion and tissue protection. Obtained results indicate that local application of AD-MSC cell sheets to promote angiogenesis and protect skeletal muscle from ischemia can be a promising approach for therapeutic use.","Adiposederived mesenchymal stromal cells; Angiogenesis; Cell sheet; Cell therapy; Limb ischemia","scleroprotein; adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cell; adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cell sheet; adipose tissue cell; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell engineering; controlled study; histology; limb ischemia; limb perfusion; mesenchymal stroma cell; mouse; muscle ischemia; nonhuman; skeletal muscle; stem cell transplantation; survival rate",,,23131829,,,,"Russian",2-s2.0-84961711475

Donskogo str., Kaliningrad, Russian Federation","One of major components of aquatic ecosystems are macrophytes - the large metaphytes normally develop in conditions of exuberant humidification. This group of hydrobionts represents an initial part in circulation of matter and energy as primary producers of organic matter. Macrophytes influence chemical and physical properties of water by accumulation of nutrients. Besides they are habitats for many organisms at various stages of development, including nesting birds, fish eggs and larvae. That is why assessment of macrophyte store and accumulation of nutrients in macrophyte tissues became the one of important objectives of environmental monitoring and management. In August 2005 the geobotanical mapping of the Curonian Lagoon coast from the research vessel to evaluate distribution of reed (Phragmites communis Trin.) and bulrush (Scirpus lacustris L.) was conducted. The area of macrophyte thickets is approximately 480 ha for reed and 305 ha for bulrush. At the same time biomass samples of reed and bulrush (not less then 10 samples per one plant community, 61 samples in total) were taken along the coastline. The samples were weighed in air-dry state; the data were processed with the computer programs Microsoft Excel 97 and Statistica. The average air-dry biomass is 993 g/m2 for reed, and 470 g/m2 for bulrush. So the macrophyte store in the Russian part of the Curonian Lagoon is approximately 4766,4 tons of air-dry mass for reed and 1433,5 tons for bulrush. The average values of concentrations of phosphorus in tissues of dominating macrophyte species (in mgP/g of dry matter) sampled in August 2005 in the Curonian Lagoon and analysed with a photometer are 6,7 mgP/g for reed and 4,1 mgP/g for bulrush. For concentrations of nitrogen the values are 28,8 and 21,3 mgN/g accordingly. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Environmental management; Histology; Lakes; Nutrients; Ships; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Aquatic vegetation; Biomass samples; Chemical and physical properties; Environmental Monitoring; Phragmites communis; Plant communities; Primary producers; Research vessels; Aquatic ecosystems",,,,9781509002122,,,"English",2-s2.0-84960968806

Control over the gel porosity is a critical issue due to the need for cells to proliferate and migrate and to ensure the transport of nutrition and metabolites. Gel loading with bioactive molecules is desired for target release of soluble signals to guide cell function. Calcium-alginate hydrogels are one of the most popular gels successfully utilized as polymer scaffolds. Here we propose a benchtop approach to design porous alginate gels by dispersion of CaCO<inf>3</inf> vaterite crystals in sodium alginate followed by the crystal elimination. CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystals play a triple role being (i) cross-linkers (a source of calcium ions to cross-link gel network), (ii) pore-makers (leaching of crystals retains the empty pores), and (iii) reservoirs with (bio)molecules (by molecule preloading into the crystals). Pore dimensions, interconnectivity, and density can be adjusted by choosing the size, concentration, and packing of the sacrificial CaCO<inf>3</inf> crystals. An opportunity to load the pores with biomolecules was demonstrated using FITC-labeled dextrans of different molecular masses from 10 to 500 kDa. The dextrans were preloaded into CaCO<inf>3</inf> vaterite crystals, and the subsequent crystal removal resulted in encapsulation of dextrans inside the pores of the gel. The dextran release rate from the gel pores depends on the equilibration of the gel structure as concluded by comparing dextran release kinetics during gelation (fast) and dextran diffusion into the performed gel (slower). Macromolecule binding to the gel is electrostatically driven as found for lysozyme and insulin. The application of porous gels as scaffolds potentially offering biomacromolecule encapsulation/release performance might be useful for alginate gel-based applications such as tissue engineering. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Alginate; Calcium; Dextran; Gelation; Gels; Hydrogels; Molecules; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Bioactive molecules; Biomacromolecule; Cellular organization; Electrostatically driven; Interconnectivity; Polymer scaffolds; Tissue constructs; Tissue engineering applications; Scaffolds (biology); alginic acid; calcium carbonate; gel; glucuronic acid; hexuronic acid; chemistry; confocal microscopy; gel; scanning electron microscopy; tissue scaffold; Alginates; Calcium Carbonate; Gels; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Tissue Scaffolds","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; DAAD, Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung",,07437463,,LANGD,26345198,"English",2-s2.0-84942850000

A novel direct ionization mass spectrometric method for identifying pathological differences in tissues is proposed. The method is based on simultaneous extraction of tissue lipids and electrospray ionization which allows mass spectrometric data to be obtained directly from soft tissues. The advantage of this method is the stable flow of solvent, which leads to stable time-dependent spectra. The tissues included necrotized tissues and tumor tissues in different combinations. Capability for direct analysis of samples of dissected tissues during the neurosurgical procedure is demonstrated. Data validation is conducted by compound identification using precise masses from the MS profile, MS/MS, and isotopic distribution structure analysis. The method can be upgraded and applied for real-time identification of tissues during surgery. This paper describes the technique and its application perspective. For these purposes, other methods were compared with the investigated one and the results were shown to be reproducible. Differences in lipid profiles were observed even in tissues from one patient where distinctions between different samples could be poor.

The role of the composition and structure of scaffolds in the maintenance of cell functions (proliferation, differentiation, and migration) was demonstrated in two experimental models: homogeneous tissue analogues (scaffold populated by fibroblasts) and complex skin equivalents (fibroblasts and keratinocytes). In contrast to collagen scaffolds, pure chitosan inhibited the growth of fibroblasts that did not form contacts with chitosan fibers, but formed specific cellular conglomerates, spheroids, and lose their ability to synthesize natural extracellular matrix. However, the use of chitosan as an additive stimulated proliferative activity of fibroblasts on collagen, which can be associated with improvement of mechanical properties of the collagen scaffolds. The effectiveness of chitosan as an additional cross-linking agent also manifested in its ability to improve significantly the resistance of collagen scaffolds to fibroblast contraction in comparison with glutaraldehyde treatment. Polymer scaffolds (without cells) accelerated complete healing of skin wounds in vivo irrespective of their composition healing, pure chitosan sponge being most effective.

The method benefits from using a handheld force-controlled ultrasound probe, which provides the contact force magnitude and therefore improves repeatability of displacement field estimation. The displacement field is estimated in a two-phase manner using triplets of RF data frames consisting of a pre-compression image and two post-compression images obtained with lower and higher compression ratios. First, a reliable displacement field estimate is calculated for the first post-compression frame. Second, we use this displacement estimate to warp the second post-compression frame while using linear elasticity to obtain an initial approximation. Final displacement estimation is refined using the warped image. The two-phase displacement estimation allows for higher compression ratios, thus increasing the practical resolution of the strain estimates. The strain field is computed from a displacement field using a smoothness- regularized energy functional, which takes into consideration local displacement estimation quality. The minimization is performed using an efficient primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm, which can leverage the architecture of a graphical processing unit. The method is quantitatively evaluated using finite element simulations. We compute strain estimates for tissue-mimicking phantoms with known elastic properties and finally perform a qualitative validation using in vivo patient data. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Data compression; Hospital data processing; Image matching; Medical imaging; Probes; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Ultrasonics; Displacement estimation; Finite element simulations; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Higher compression ratios; Primal dual hybrid gradient algorithms; Tissue mimicking phantom; Two-phase displacements; Ultrasound elastography; Finite element method; algorithm; echography; elastography; human; image processing; imaging phantom; liver; liver tumor; procedures; reproducibility; Algorithms; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results",,,08853010,,ITUCE,26276958,"English",2-s2.0-84939548968

Since the first derivation in 1998, they have been an attractive source of cells for regenerative medicine. Numerous ethical, technological, and regulatory complications have been hampering hPSC use in clinical applications. Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), parthenogenetic human ESCs, human nuclear transfer ESCs, and induced pluripotent stem cells are four types of hPSCs that are different in many clinically relevant features such as propensity to epigenetic abnormalities, generation methods, and ability for development of autologous cell lines. Propensity to genetic mutations and tumorigenicity are common features of all pluripotent cells that complicate hPSC-based therapies. Several recent advances in methods of derivation, culturing, and monitoring of hPSCs have addressed many ethical concerns and technological challenges in development of clinical-grade hPSC lines. Generation of banks of such lines may be useful to minimize immune rejection of hPSC-derived allografts. In this review, we discuss different sources of hPSCs available at the moment, various safety risks associated with them, and possible solutions for successful use of hPSCs in the clinic.

Paul et al., 2010). The phylogenetic distance between humans and laboratory animals is enormous, this affects the transferability of animal data on the efficacy of neuroprotective drugs. Therefore, many neuroprotective treatments that have shown promise in animals have not been successful when transferred to humans (. Dragunow, 2008; Gibbons and Dragunow, 2010). We present a multi-organ chip capable of maintaining 3D tissues derived from various cell sources in a combined media circuit which bridges the gap in systemic and human tests. A steady state co-culture of human artificial liver microtissues and human neurospheres exposed to fluid flow over two weeks in the multi-organ chip has successfully proven its long-term performance. Daily lactate dehydrogenase activity measurements of the medium and immunofluorescence end-point staining proved the viability of the tissues and the maintenance of differentiated cellular phenotypes. Moreover, the lactate production and glucose consumption values of the tissues cultured indicated that a stable steady-state was achieved after 6 days of co-cultivation. The neurospheres remained differentiated neurons over the two-week cultivation in the multi-organ chip, proven by qPCR and immunofluorescence of the neuronal markers βIII-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein-2. Additionally, a two-week toxicity assay with a repeated substance exposure to the neurotoxic 2,5-hexanedione in two different concentrations induced high apoptosis within the neurospheres and liver microtissues, as shown by a strong increase of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the medium. The principal finding of the exposure of the co-culture to 2,5-hexanedione was that not only toxicity profiles of two different doses could be discriminated, but also that the co-cultures were more sensitive to the substance compared to respective single-tissue cultures in the multi-organ-chip. Thus, we provide here a new in vitro tool which might be utilized to predict the safety and efficacy of substances in clinical studies more accurately in the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","In vitro substance testing; Liver; Multi-organ-chip; Neurospheres; Organoids; Tissue engineering","Animals; Artificial organs; Cell death; Flow of fluids; Fluorescence; Histology; Ketones; Liver; Mobile security; Neurons; Polymerase chain reaction; Tissue culture; Tissue engineering; Toxicity; Cellular phenotypes; In-vitro; Lactate dehydrogenase activities; Long term performance; Microtubule associated protein; Multi-organ-chip; Neurospheres; Organoids; Tissue; 2,5-hexanedione; alkanone; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell survival; coculture; cytology; drug effects; human; liver; metabolism; microfluidic analysis; multicellular spheroid; nerve cell; procedures; tissue culture technique; tumor cell line; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Hexanones; Humans; Liver; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Neurons; Spheroids, Cellular; Tissue Culture Techniques",,,01681656,,JBITD,25678136,"English",2-s2.0-84930957041

Current methods for SWI-OCE involve multiple temporal optical coherence tomography scans (M-mode) at different spatial locations across tissue surface (B- and C-modes). This requires an excitation for each measurement position leading to clinically unacceptable long acquisition times up to tens of minutes. In this Letter, we demonstrate, for the first time, noncontact true kilohertz frame-rate OCE by combining a Fourier domain mode-locked swept source laser with an A-scan rate of ∼1.5 MHz and a focused air-pulse as an elastic wave excitation source. The propagation of the elastic wave in the sample was imaged at a frame rate of ∼7.3 kHz. Therefore, to quantify the elastic wave propagation velocity in a single direction, only a single excitation was needed. This method was validated by quantifying the elasticity of tissue-mimicking agar phantoms as well as of a porcine cornea ex vivo at different intraocular pressures. The results demonstrate that this method can reduce the acquisition time of an elastogram to milliseconds. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,"Biomechanics; Fourier series; Laser excitation; Medical imaging; Optical tomography; Shear flow; Shear waves; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Wave propagation; Acquisition time; Intra ocular pressure; Local mechanical properties; Measurement positions; Optical coherence elastography; Quantitative assessments; Shear wave imaging; Single excitation; Elastic waves; animal; cornea; cytology; devices; elastography; imaging phantom; optical instrumentation; pig; procedures; Animals; Cornea; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Optical Devices; Phantoms, Imaging; Swine","1R01EY022362, NIH, National Institutes of Health; 1R01HL120140, NIH, National Institutes of Health; U54HG006348, NIH, National Institutes of Health",,01469592,,OPLED,26030564,"English",2-s2.0-84959354006

Although polyester-based microcarriers have been already used for this purpose, their surface properties should be improved to provide better cell growth. The goal of this study was to prepare microbeads based on poly(D,L-lactide) acid, poly(L-lactide) acid, and to study cell behavior (adhesion, spreading, growth, and proliferation) in function of microbead topography and surface chemistry. To improve L-929 fibro-blasts adhesion, microbead surface has been modified with three polycations: chitosan, poly(2-dimethylamino ethylmetha-crylate) (PDMAEMA), or chitosan-g-oligolactide copolymer (chit-g-OLA). Although modification of the microbead surface with chitosan and PDMAEMA was performed through physical adsorption on the previously prepared microbeads, chit-g-OLA copolymer was introduced directly during microbead processing. This simple approach (1) bypass the use of an emulsifier (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA); (2) avoid surface ""contamination"" with PVA molecules limiting a control of the surface characteristics. In vitro study of the growth of mouse fibroblasts on the microbeads showed that both surface topography and chemistry affected cell attachment, spreading, and proliferation.

Analysis of newly formed hemopoietic organs was performed after 3 and 5 months. The total amount of hemopoietic cells, number of multipotent stromal cells, efficiency of colony formation from these cells, and weight of bone capsule of the transplants were measured. Microscopic study showed that 5-month transplants were significantly larger than 3-month transplants and contained 3-fold more hemopoietic cells (20-fold in the AILIH+EHF group). The number of multipotent stromal cells was maximum in EHF+AILIH group (by 2.2 times higher than in the control) and minimum in AILIH+EHF group.

Zr-Si scaffolds with 150, 200, and 250 μm pore sizes are seeded with human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) and human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) and cultured in osteoinductive and control media for three weeks. Osteogenic differentiation of hASCs and hBMSCs and formation of bone matrix is comparatively analyzed via alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), calcium quantification, osteocalcin staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is observed that the 150 μm pore size Zr-Si scaffolds support the strongest matrix mineralization, as confirmed by calcium deposition. Analysis of ALP activity, osteocalcin staining and SEM observations of matrix mineralization reveal that mesenchymal stem cells cultured on 3-D scaffolds without osteogenic stimulation spontaneously differentiate towards osteogenic lineage. Nanoindentation measurements show that aging of the 2PP-produced Zr-Si scaffolds in aqueous or alcohol media results in an increase in the scaffold Young's modulus and hardness. Moreover, accelerated formation of bone matrix by hASCs is noted, when cultured on the scaffolds with lower Young's moduli and hardness values (non aged scaffolds) compared to the cells cultured on scaffolds with higher Young's modulus and hardness values (aged scaffolds).

The most common HIFU regime is thermal ablation. Recently there has been increasing interest in generating purely mechanical lesions in tissue (histotripsy). This paper provides an overview of several studies on the development of histotripsy methods toward clinical applications. Two histotripsy approaches and examples of their applications are presented. In one approach, sequences of high-amplitude, short (microsecond-long), focused ultrasound pulses periodically produce dense, energetic bubble clouds that mechanically disintegrate tissue. In an alternative approach, longer (millisecond-long) pulses with shock fronts generate boiling bubbles and the interaction of shock fronts with the resulting vapour cavity causes tissue disintegration. Recent preclinical studies on histotripsy are reviewed for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), liver and kidney tumours, kidney stone fragmentation, enhancing anti-tumour immune response, and tissue decellularisation for regenerative medicine applications. Potential clinical advantages of the histotripsy methods are discussed. Histotripsy methods can be used to mechanically ablate a wide variety of tissues, whilst selectivity sparing structures such as large vessels. Both ultrasound and MR imaging can be used for targeting and monitoring the treatment in real time. Although the two approaches utilise different mechanisms for tissue disintegration, both have many of the same advantages and offer a promising alternative method of non-invasive surgery. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

Material and methods. Nine matrix types, such as porous materials reconstructed from collagen solution; a collagen sponge-vicryl mesh composite; decellularized and freeze-dried bovine, equine, and fish dermis; small intestinal submucosa, decellularized bovine dura mater; and decellularized human femoral artery, were implanted subcutaneously in 225 rats. The tissues at the implantation site were investigated for a period of 5 to 90 days. Classical histology and nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) were applied. Results. The investigations showed no rejection of all the collagen materials. The period of matrix bioresorption varied from 10 days for collagen sponges to 2 months for decellularized and freeze-dried vessels and vicryl meshes. Collagen was prone to macrophage resorption and enzymatic lysis, being replaced by granulation tissue and then fibrous tissue, followed by its involution. NLOM allowed the investigators to study the number, density, interposition, and spatial organization of collagen structures in the matrices and adjacent tissues, and their change over time during implantation. Conclusion. The performed investigation could recommend three matrices: hybrid collagen/vicryl composite; decellularized bovine dermis; and decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa, which are most adequate for tissue engineering in urology. These and other collagen matrices may be used in different areas of regenerative medicine.","Collagen; Matrices; Morphology; Scaffolds; Tissue engineering; Urology","biomaterial; collagen; animal; biodegradable implant; bovine; fish; horse; human; pig; prostheses and orthoses; rat; regenerative medicine; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; ultrastructure; Absorbable Implants; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Cattle; Collagen; Fishes; Horses; Humans; Prostheses and Implants; Rats; Regenerative Medicine; Swine; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds",,,00041955,,ARPTA,26841647,"Russian",2-s2.0-84960987097

Because the paracrine action of bioactive factors secreted by MSC is considered as a main mechanism underlying MSC regenerative effects, application of MSC extracellular secreted products could be a promising approach to stimulate tissue regeneration; it also has some advantages compared to the injection of the cells themselves. However, because of the complexity of composition and multiplicity of mechanisms of action distinguished the medicinal products based on bioactive factors secreted by human MSC from the most of pharmaceuticals, it is important to develop the approaches to their standardization and quality control.

The feature of planarian to regenerate in new individual planarian from a piece, which is only 1/7 of the original animal, allowed to create the alternative methods of testing of drugs, dietary supplements, water quality, influence of electromagnetic fields, and other radiations. The tests on planarian can replace the ones that are held today on mammals. However, the lacks of the bioassays based on the planarian regeneration are the need for complex and expensive video equipment for recording the regrowth of worms' body, the difficulties of culturing of flatworms and fairly long period of response. These difficulties can be avoided by using another group of the worms of type Annelida. The new individual can be fully recovered only from the front half of the body in many species of earthworms. Thus, the influence of the pharmaceuticals from earthworms, mummy, and Orthilia secunda on the ability of earthworms to regenerate lost tail segments has been investigated. The relations of the activity of preparations tested with doses and the time of the storage have been revealed.

Objectives: As an initial step to create a new ex vivo TE model of cancer, we optimized protocols to obtain organ-specific acellular matrices and evaluated their potential as TE scaffolds for culture of normal and tumor cells. Methods and results: Effective decellularization of animals'™ kidneys, ureter, lungs, heart, and liver has been achieved by detergent-based processing. The obtained scaffolds demonstrated biocompatibility and growthsupporting potential in combination with normal (Vero, MDCK) and tumor cell lines (C26, B16). Acellular scaffolds and TE constructs have been characterized and compared with morphological methods.

Building upon the results from in vivo experiments, we formulated a hypothesis that the speed of the initial tissue re-growth response is determined by the early migration of SMCs from the injured intima. To test this hypothesis, a cellular Potts model of the stented artery is developedwhere stent struts were deployed at different depths into the tissue. An extreme scenario with a ruptured internal elastic lamina was also considered to study the role of severe injury in tissue re-growth. Based on the outcomes, we hypothesize that a deeper stent deployment results in on average larger fenestrae in the elastic lamina, allowing easier migration of SMCs into the lumen. The data also suggest that growth of the neointimal lesions owing to SMC proliferation is strongly dependent on the initial number of migrated cells,which forman initial condition for the later phase of the vascular repair. This mechanism could explain the in vivo observation that the initial rate of neointima formation and injury score are strongly correlated. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Biocompatible implants have been shown to be understood to mean both: those, which are not rejected by the body as well as those, which are not capsulated in the body. They are to be fabricated according to one-stage frontal photopolymerization with extreme low reaction front to avoid defect formation in a polymer. Moreover, an additional unstable stage is required to result in the death of end free macroradicals and labile products in a polymer. For implant fabrication we used photopolimerizable compositions resulting in the formation of hydrophobic spatially cross-linked polymers, their correlation time of spinning motion of a paramagnetic probe of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4- oxypiperidine-1-oxide approximately being 6·10–10 s. The fulfillment of these conditions means the use of radically polymerizable oligomerbased compositions (oligoester methacrylates, oligocarbonate methacrylates, oligourethane methacrylates, etc.). Compositions having lower or higher correlation time of the specified probe are not appropriate for the fabrication of biocompatible and biostable implants. The characteristics of oligomer-monomer compounds have a greater effect on physicochemical properties of implants rather than on their biocompatibility and biostability. No implant incapsulation is determined by the initial composition formulation provided that the mentioned conditions are fulfilled. A polymer in biostable and biocompatible implants can be only optically transparent, though the converse is not necessary. © 2015, Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy.

The computational study of a model problem at typical geometrical, optical, and thermal parameters confirms the acceptable accuracy of the 1-D solution for the temperature field formed in human tissues during thermal treatment with periodic infrared irradiation. The effects of uncertainties in spectral absorption coefficients and thermal conductivity of biological tissues on thermal treatment parameters are analyzed.

The spectral peculiarities observed will be discussed and the endogenous sources of the fluorescence signal will be addressed. For these fluorescence spectroscopy measurements the FluoroLog 3 system (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France) was used. It consists of a Xe lamp (300 W, 200-650 nm), a double mono-chromators, and a PMT detector with a work region at 220-850 nm. Autofluorescence signals were detected in the form of excitation-emission matrices for the samples of normal mucosa, dysphasia and colon carcinoma and specific spectral features for each tissue were found. Autofluorescence signals from the same samples are observed through synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, which is a novel promising modality for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of bio-samples. It is one of the most powerful techniques for multicomponent analysis, because of its sensitivity. In the SFS regime, the fluorescence signal is recorded while both excitation λexc and emission wavelengths λem are simultaneously scanned. A constant wavelength interval is maintained between the λexc and λem wavelengths throughout the spectrum. The resulted fluorescence spectrum shows narrower peak widths, in comparison with EEMs, which are easier for identification and minimizes the chance for false determinations or pretermission of specific spectral feature. This modality is also faster, than EEMs, a much smaller number of data points are required.1 In our measurements we use constant wavelength interval Δλ in the region of 10-200 nm. Measurements are carried out in the terms of finding Δλ, which results in a spectrum with most specific spectral features for comparison with spectral characteristics observed in EEMs. Implementing synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy in optical methods for analyzing biological tissues could result in a better differentiation between normal and dysplastic tissue. Thus could establish fluorescence imaging as a diagnostic modality among optical techniques applied in clinical practice. © 2015 SPIE.","cancer diagnosis; colon carcinoma; excitation emission matrices; synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy","Fluorescence spectroscopy; Histology; Matrix algebra; Optical engineering; Quantum electronics; Tissue; Cancer diagnosis; Colon carcinoma; Excitation emission matrices; Fluorescence properties; Multi-component analysis; Spectral characteristics; Spectroscopy measurements; Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy; Fluorescence",,,0277786X,9781628415636,PSISD,,"English",2-s2.0-84922688240

The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) irradiation of low intensity on cultured cells derived from different biological tissues (spleen, bone marrow, and Ehrlich's adenocarcinoma), which were immobilized in a porous TiNi-based alloy scaffold. Accordingly, the following objectives were set: i) to evaluate the impact of low-intensity radiation on cell suspensions, and ii) to carry out a comparative analysis of the viability of cells immobilized in porous TiNi-based alloy and IR- and UV-irradiated. The data show that the extracellular environment of bone marrow, tumor and spleen cell populations affects their viability and proliferative potency in porous TiNi-based scaffolds. IR- and UV irradiation of cell cultures immobilized in the scaffold affects the cell viability in populations of bone marrow, tumor, and spleen cells. In case of IR irradiation, cell viability was significantly improved, at the same time UV irradiation suppressed cell proliferation activity. The effect of IR irradiation can be used to resuscitate the cell area. The effect of UV irradiation can be used to destroy residual tumor lesions or other pathological cell populations. Effects of low-intensity infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the number of viable cells were evaluated against the control group in which cells were exposed to natural daylight.

The main objective of this research is obtainment of decellularized esophagus matrices in non-human primate models followed by pathomorphological evaluation. A modified detergentenzymatic method involving sodium deoxycholate and DNAse was used for esophagus decellularization. The conducted morphological investigation proved preservation of tissue architectonics as well as absence of cells and nuclear material. Evaluation of biomechanical properties of the scaffold revealed similar mechanical strength characteristics in native and decellularized samples; however, rupturing deformation was higher.

Based on the measured stiffness of soft tissues during palpation, medical doctors can distinguish pathological tissues. In this study, an image-assisted method is developed for estimating the elastic modulus of soft tissues in order to quantify the local stiffness for the palpation purpose. The method uses a modified contact model which relates the contact radius and contact force to estimate the elastic modulus of objects. The modified contact model was derived from the Hertz contact model and calibrated by the finite element method. Experimental results on polydimethylsiloxane show that the method can accurately predict the elastic modulus. In this study the porcine liver was employed as an example of the soft tissues. When a porcine liver is tested, aqueous humors appear on the surface of the tissue, creating a false contact area. An additional method for correcting the contact area error is also proposed. After the correction, the elastic modulus of six porcine liver samples was found to be 40.4 ± 24.1 kPa. The results reveal that the image-assisted method is feasible for the porcine liver. It may also be applied to other soft tissues. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Aqueous humors; Contact model; Elastic modulus; Image-assisted method; Soft tissues","Body fluids; Elastic moduli; End effectors; Estimation; Silicones; Stiffness; Tissue; Aqueous humor; Contact modeling; Contact radius; Hertz contact model; Image-assisted method; Medical doctors; Pathological tissue; Soft tissue; Tissue engineering",,,09244247,,SAAPE,,"English",2-s2.0-84897552580

ABMi therapy uses 400 mL of autologous bone marrow obtained under general anesthesia and infused mononuclear cells from the peripheral vein. The clinical study expanded and we treated liver cirrhosis induced by HCV and HBV infection and alcohol consumption. We found that the ABMi therapy was effective for cirrhosis patients and now we are treating patients with combined HIV and HCV infection and with metabolic syndrome-induced liver cirrhosis. Currently, to substantiate our findings that liver cirrhosis can be successfully treated by the ABMi therapy, we are conducting randomized multicenter clinical studies designated ""Advanced medical technology B"" for HCV-related liver cirrhosis in Japan. On the basis of our clinical study, we developed a proof-of-concept showing that infusion of bone marrow cells (BMCs) improved liver fibrosis and sequentially activated proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells and hepatocytes, further promoting restoration of liver functions. To treat patients with severe forms of liver cirrhosis, we continued translational research to develop less invasive therapies by using mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. We obtained a small quantity of BMCs under local anesthesia and expanded them into mesenchymal stem cells that will then be used for treating cirrhosis.

The aim of the present work is to demonstrate that the calcification is to be mitigated by means of treatment of bovine pericardium in solutions of chitosan in carbonic acid, i.e. water saturated with carbon dioxide at high pressure. This acidic aqueous fluid unusually combines antimicrobial properties with absolute biocompatibility as far as at normal pressure it decomposes spontaneously and completely into H2O and CO2. Yet, at high pressures it can protonate and dissolve chitosan materials with different degrees of acetylation (in the range of 16-33%, at least) without any further pretreatment. Even exposure of the bovine pericardium in pure carbonic acid solution without chitosan already favours certain reduction in calcification, somewhat improved mechanical properties, complete biocompatibility and evident antimicrobial activity of the treated collagen tissue. The reason may be due to high extraction ability of this peculiar compressed fluidic mixture. Moreover, exposure of the bovine pericardium in solutions of chitosan in carbonic acid introduces even better mechanical properties and highly pronounced antimicrobial activity of the modified collagen tissue against adherence and biofilm formation of relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Yet, the most important achievement is the detected dramatic reduction in calcification for such modified collagen tissues in spite of the fact that the amount of the thus introduced chitosan is rather small (typically ca. 1 wt.%), which has been reliably detected using original tritium labelling method. We believe that these improved properties are achieved due to particularly deep and uniform impregnation of the collagen matrix with chitosan from its pressurised solutions in carbonic acid. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main process parameters that influence ultrafine fiber diameter and properties (polymer concentration, solution feeding rate, working distance, and applied voltage) have been investigated and their effects evaluated. The study revealed electrospinning parameters for the production of high-quality ultrafine fibers and determined which parameters should be varied to tailor the properties of the products. This study is the first to compare biological and physical-mechanical parameters of PHAs with different chemical compositions as dependent upon the fractions of monomers constituting the polymers and ultrafine fiber orientation. Mechanical strength of aligned ultrafine fibers prepared from different PHAs is higher than that of randomly oriented ones; no significant effect of ultrafine fiber orientation on surface properties has been found. None of the fibrous scaffolds produced by electrospinning from PHAs had any adverse effects on attachment, growth, and viability of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, and all of them were found to be suitable for tissue engineering applications. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Electrospinning; Fibroblast cells; Physicalmechanical properties; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Ultrafine fibers","Electrospinning parameters; Fibroblast cells; Physical-mechanical properties; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Polymer concentrations; Structure and properties; Tissue engineering applications; Ultra-fine fibers; Cell culture; Fibers; Fibroblasts; Polymers; Scaffolds (biology); Electrospinning; molecular scaffold; monomer; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; animal cell; article; cell adhesion; cell growth; cell viability; chemical composition; chemical structure; electrospinning; fibroblast; molecular mechanics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; surface property; tissue engineering; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Adhesion; Cell Survival; Fibroblasts; Materials Testing; Mechanical Phenomena; Mice; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; NIH 3T3 Cells; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Polymers; Solutions; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds",,,09205063,,JBSEE,24295429,"English",2-s2.0-84892366081

Mesenchymal stem cells with their potential to differentiate in various cell types, cryopreserved adhesion-based in fabricated scaffolds of biocompatible materials can serve as ready-to-use transplantation units for tissue repair, where pores allow a direct contact of graft cells and recipient tissue without further preparation. A successful cryopreservation of adherent cells depends on attachment and spreading processes that start directly after cell seeding. Here, we analyzed different cultivation times (0.5, 2, 24 h) prior to adhesion-based cryopreservation of human mesenchymal stem cells within alginate-gelatin cryogel scaffolds and its influence on cell viability, recovery and functionality at recovery times (0, 24, 48 h) in comparison to non-frozen control. Analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicated that 2 h cultivation time enhanced cryopreservation success: cell number, visual cell contacts, membrane integrity, motility, as well as spreading were comparable to control. In contrast, cell number by short cultivation time (0.5 h) reduced dramatically after thawing and expanded cultivation time (24 h) decreased cell viability.

Although induction of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation was observed, a complete evaluation of bone deposition and biodegradation processes was missing due to technical limitations. In the current study, both X-ray computed microtomography and histological analysis were used to monitor these two key biological processes in the same in vitro model.

The method uses the local diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with optical fiber probe including one emitting and two reading There are several features in the method: the value to be determined is absolute concentration of admixtures; the method needs no calibration measurements on phantoms; it needs no reference measurements on sample with zero admixture concentration; it uses a two parametric kinetic light propagation model and original algorithms to resolve direct and inverse tasks of radiation transport theory. Experimental testing passed with tissue equivalent phantoms and different admixtures, including a chlorine photosensitizer, showed accuracy under 10% in all cases. © 2014 SPIE.","Admixture; Biological tissue; Concentration of dye; Diffuse reflectance; Monte Carlo method; Non-destructive measurement; Photodynamic diagnostics; Turbid media","Absorption spectroscopy; Chemotherapy; Light scattering; Medical applications; Monte Carlo methods; Optical fibers; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitizers; Reflection; Statistical mechanics; Tissue; Turbidity; Admixture; Biological tissues; Diffuse reflectance; Non-destructive measurement; Turbid media; Tissue engineering",,,16057422,9780819498656,,,"English",2-s2.0-84897450373

Some of its practical applications are described. Using a number of steroid hormones as examples, we demonstrate that terahertz spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics methods and computer simulation allows one to gain information about the structure of molecules in crystals. A 'terahertz colour vision' method is proposed for analysis of pulsed terahertz signals reflected from biological tissues and it is shown that this method can be effectively used to analyse the properties of biological tissues and for early skin cancer diagnosis. © 2014 Kvantovaya Elektronika and Turpion Ltd.","Biological tissue; Colour vision; Molecular crystal; Terahertz radiation","Color vision; Computer simulation; Electromagnetic wave emission; Molecular crystals; Molecular dynamics; Terahertz spectroscopy; Terahertz waves; Tissue; Biological tissues; Molecular dynamics methods; Nano-scale system; Nanostructured systems; Pulsed terahertz spectroscopies; Structure of molecules; Terahertz frequency range; Terahertz radiation; Tissue engineering","12-08-00921, RFBR, Russian Foundation for Basic Research; 13-02-01364, RFBR, Russian Foundation for Basic Research; 14-02-00979, RFBR, Russian Foundation for Basic Research",,10637818,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84905442774

A limitation of this approach for in vivo deep tissue imaging is the fact that blue light emitted by the photoprotein is highly absorbed by tissue. Seven novel coelenterazine analogues were synthesized and their effects on the bioluminescent properties of recombinant obelin from Obelia longissima and aequorin from Aequorea victoria were evaluated. Only analogues having electron-donating groups (m-OCH3 and m-OH) on the C6 phenol moiety or an extended resonance system at the C8 position (1-naphthyl and α-styryl analogues) showed a significant red shift of light emission. Of these, only the α-styryl analogue displayed a sufficiently high light intensity to allow eventual tissue penetration. The possible suitability of this compound for in vivo assays was corroborated by studies with aequorin which allowed the monitoring of [Ca2+]i dynamics in cultured CHO cells and in hippocampal brain slices.

In this work, we evaluated the effect of lyophilized PRP on bone regeneration when associated with a silicon stabilized hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate scaffold in a rabbit calvarial defect (Skelite™). Critical defects were created in the calvaria of twenty-four rabbits. The periosteum was removed and the defects were either left empty or filled with allogeneic PRP gel; Skelite particles; Skelite and PRP gel. Four animals were killed after 4 weeks, 10 animals after 8 and 10 after 16 weeks. Specimens were processed for X-ray microtomography (μCT) and for resin embedded histology. μCT analysis revealed significant osteoid-like matrix and new bone deposition in PRP + Skelite group at both 8 and 16 weeks in respect to Skelite alone. Histologically, PRP + Skelite defects were highly cellular with more abundant osteoid deposition and more regular collagen fibres. Moreover, in vitro migration assays confirmed the chemotactic effect of PRP to endothelial and osteoprogenitor cells. We conclude that the addition of PRP influenced the local tissue microenvironment by providing key cryptic factors for regeneration, thereby enhancing progenitor cell recruitment, collagen and bone matrix deposition, and by creating a bridging interface between the scaffold and bone. © 2013 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

Seeded allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells spontaneously differentiate (proven by gene-, protein and functional evaluations) into epithelial-And muscle-like cells. The reseeded scaffolds are used to orthotopically replace the entire cervical oesophagus in immunocompetent rats.

Here we developed a method for the preparation of adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheet that obviated the need of thermo-responsive dishes. This method only required the seeding of rabbit ASC onto 6-well plates at an appropriate cell density and culture in appropriate medium, and the cells were able to develop into ASC sheet in 2 days. The ASC sheetallowed for transduction with the hybrid baculovirus at efficiencies >97%, conferring robust and prolonged (>35 days) overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The ASC sheet was easily detached by brief (10s) trypsinization and saline wash, while retaining the extracellular matrix and desired physical properties. The ASC sheet formation and VEGF expression promoted cell survival under hypoxia invitro. Epicardial implantation of the VEGF-expressing ASC sheet to rabbit MI models reduced the infarct size and improved cardiac functions to non-diseased levels, as judged from the left ventrical ejection fraction/myocardial perfusion. The VEGF-expressing ASC sheetalso effectively prevented myocardial wall thinning, suppressed myocardium fibrosis and enhanced blood vessel formation. These data implicated the potential of this method for the preparation of genetically engineered ASC sheet and future MI treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adipose-derived stem cells; Baculovirus; Cell sheet; Gene therapy; Myocardial infarction; Vascular endothelial growth factor","Adipose derived stem cells; Baculovirus; Cell sheet; Myocardial Infarction; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Blood vessels; Cell engineering; Cytology; Gene therapy; Stem cells; Endothelial cells; baculovirus vector; vasculotropin 165; adipose derived stem cell; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; article; Baculovirus; baculovirus expression system; capillary density; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cell density; cell survival; collateral circulation; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epicardium; epididymis; extracellular matrix; flow cytometry; heart ejection fraction; heart infarction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle fibrosis; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle perfusion; image enhancement; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rabbit; signal transduction; viral gene delivery system; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Adipose-derived stem cells; Baculovirus; Cell sheet; Gene therapy; Myocardial infarction; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Baculoviridae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Rabbits; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells; Tissue Engineering; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",,,01429612,,BIMAD,24120047,"English",2-s2.0-84887023845

However, natural polyamino acids have a similar chemical structure to synthetic polyamides (""nylons""), which are known to feature strong inter-molecular hydrogen bonding that prevents large-scale molecular motion in their solid state. Through esterification, this hydrogen bonding was partially shielded, allowing orientation of the polyamino acid macromolecules through tensile deformation. An increase in Young's modulus and tensile strength was achieved of solution-cast films of the chemically modified poly-γ-glutamic acids, consistent with enhanced uniaxial polymer chain orientation.

Number of recent reports suggests that EMF has a positive impact at different stages of healing. Processes impacted by EMF include, but are not limited to, cell migration and proliferation, expression of growth factors, nitric oxide signalling, cytokine modulation, and more. These effects have been detected even during application of low frequencies (range: 30-300 kHz) and extremely low frequencies (range: 3-30 Hz).

Importance of the transient effects arise from relatively strong scattering and long attenuation path of radiation in human tissues in the therapeutic window until the complete absorption. Our analysis is based on transport approximation for scattering phase function and the Monte Carlo method for solving the three-dimensional radiative transfer problem. Monte Carlo simulations are used to study applicability of the quasi-steady radiative transfer approach, and demonstrate that in the biomedical problem under consideration, the quasi-steady solution for absorbed radiation power is sufficiently accurate for laser pulse duration longer than 10 ps. The simulations for superficial tissues with embedded gold nanoshells, used to increase the local volumetric absorption, show that overheating of the nanoshells with respect to the ambient biological tissue is strongly dependent on the laser pulse duration. This effect becomes considerable for laser pulse duration shorter than 1-2 ns.

There have been demonstrated the matrix techniques, special attention being paid to innovative technologies of rapid prototyping — the process of 3D-imaging according to a digital model. The most applicable of these techniques for biopolymers are laser stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, and 3D-printing.

Many purulent wounds, burns and other destructive inflammatory processes are accompanied by changes in the fluorescent activity of the tissues, which occurs due to a misbalance in accumulation of natural fluorophores: FAD, NADH, lipofuscin, porphyrins, structural proteins, etc. The study of redox ratio (RR), characterizing the metabolic processes, is important in the assessment of the metabolic activity ofmicrocirculatory-tissue systems (MTS). However, one of the big problems of the FS method is still the correct interpretation of the data and the development of practical methods for its application in clinical medicine. To solve this problem and create new diagnostic criteria, we propose to evaluate the adaptive capacity of MTS using indicators of links between nutritive blood flow and redox ratio during a physiological rest and functional load (occlusion test). As is known, these parameters (RR and nutritive blood flow) characterize the metabolic activity of tissues.We have performedan experimental study of the relationship between the RR, defined by FS, and nutritive blood flow, defined by the methods of laser Doppler flowmetry. Preliminary results in the study of a complex approach to diagnosis of the state of biological tissue were obtained. A positive relationship between the nutritive blood flow in the microcirculatory channel and RR of skin tissue is observed.The speed of change of metabolism in the phase of occlusion and reperfusion and duration of phase of recovery may be the criteria for adaptive capabilities of MTS, which has practical significance for physiology and medicine. © 2015 SPIE.","fluorescence spectroscopy; laser Doppler flowmetry; metabolism; microcirculatory-tissue system; nutritive blood flow; redox ratio","Adaptive optics; Biomedical engineering; Biophysics; Blood; Classifiers; Diagnosis; Doppler effect; Flow measurement; Flowmeters; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Hemodynamics; Medicine; Metabolism; Microcirculation; Optical instruments; Physiology; Adaptive capabilities; Blood flow; Fluorescent spectroscopy; Inflammatory process; Laser doppler flowmetry; Medical technologies; microcirculatory-tissue system; Redox ratio; Tissue",,,16057422,9781628415643,,,"English",2-s2.0-84925682088

Among all stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were reported to have anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory, and angiogenic effects which are attributed to the restorative capacity of these cells. Human tooth germ stem cells (HTGSCs) having mesenchymal stem cell characteristics have been proven to exert high proliferation and differentiation capacity. Unlike bone-marrow-derived MSCs, HTGSCs can be easily isolated, expanded, and cryopreserved, which makes them an alternative stem cell source. Regardless of their sources, the stem cells are exposed to physical and chemical stresses during cryopreservation, hindering their therapeutic capacity. Amelioration of the side effects of cryopreservation on MSCs seems to be a priority in order to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of these cells.

Changes in the ECM have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular conditions including atherosclerosis, restenosis, and heart failure. Matrix components, such as collagens and noncollagenous proteins, influence the function and activity of vascular cells, particularly vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages. Matrix proteins have been shown to be implicated in the development of atherosclerotic complications, such as plaque rupture, aneurysm formation, and calcification. ECM proteins control ECM remodeling through feedback signaling to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are the key players of ECM remodeling in both normal and pathological conditions. The production of MMPs is closely related to the development of an inflammatory response and is subjected to significant changes at different stages of atherosclerosis. Indeed, blood levels of circulating MMPs may be useful for the assessment of the inflammatory activity in atherosclerosis and the prediction of cardiovascular risk. The availability of a wide variety of low-molecular MMP inhibitors that can be conjugated with various labels provides a good perspective for specific targeting of MMPs and implementation of imaging techniques to visualize MMP activity in atherosclerotic plaques and, most interestingly, to monitor responses to antiatheroslerosis therapies. Finally, because of the crucial role of ECM in cardiovascular repair, the regenerative potential of ECM could be successfully used in constructing engineered scaffolds and vessels that mimic properties of the natural ECM and consist of the native ECM components or composite biomaterials. These scaffolds possess a great promise in vascular tissue engineering. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","atherosclerosis; extracellular matrix remodeling; macrophages; matrix metalloproteinases; vascular repair; vascular smooth muscle cells","biomaterial; collagenase 3; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; interstitial collagenase; macrophage elastase; matrilysin; matrix metalloproteinase 14; matrix metalloproteinase 15; matrix metalloproteinase 16; matrix metalloproteinase 17; neutrophil collagenase; protein inhibitor; stromelysin; stromelysin 2; stromelysin 3; tissue scaffold; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; blood level; calcification; cardiovascular risk; engineering; extracellular matrix; imaging; inflammation; macrophage; nonhuman; protein function; review; vascular surgery; vascular tissue; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Biological Markers; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Collagen Type VIII; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Macrophages; Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Monocytes; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; T-Lymphocytes; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases; Vascular Calcification",,,10615377,,CRVIE,23422022,"English",2-s2.0-84885648225

In the late 1960s, a strong interest was raised in studying ceramics as potential bone grafts due to their biomechanical properties. A bit later, such synthetic biomaterials were called bioceramics. In principle, bioceramics can be prepared from diverse materials but this review is limited to calcium orthophosphate-based formulations only, which possess the specific advantages due to the chemical similarity to mammalian bones and teeth. During the past 40 years, there have been a number of important achievements in this field. Namely, after the initial development of bioceramics that was just tolerated in the physiological environment, an emphasis was shifted towards the formulations able to form direct chemical bonds with the adjacent bones. Afterwards, by the structural and compositional controls, it became possible to choose whether the calcium orthophosphate-based implants remain biologically stable once incorporated into the skeletal structure or whether they were resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of regenerative bioceramics was developed and such formulations became an integrated part of the tissue engineering approach. Now calcium orthophosphate scaffolds are designed to induce bone formation and vascularization. These scaffolds are often porous and harbor different biomolecules and/or cells. Therefore, current biomedical applications of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics include bone augmentations, artificial bone grafts, maxillofacial reconstruction, spinal fusion, periodontal disease repairs and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Perspective future applications comprise drug delivery and tissue engineering purposes because calcium orthophosphates appear to be promising carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and various types of cells. © 2013 by the authors.","Bioceramics; Biomaterials; Biomedical applications; Calcium orthophosphates; Grafts; Hydroxyapatite; Tissue engineering; Tricalcium phosphate","Biomechanical properties; Biomedical applications; Compositional control; Maxillofacial reconstruction; Physiological environment; Skeletal structures; Synthetic biomaterials; Tri-calcium phosphates; Bioceramics; Biological materials; Biomaterials; Bone; Calcium; Drug delivery; Grafts; Hydroxyapatite; Mammals; Medical applications; Tissue engineering; Scaffolds (biology)",,,19961944,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84884573729

The effect of an aqueous alcohol solution of brilliant green on the amount and sizes of structures is studied. It is demonstrated that the optical irradiation of the adipocytes that are sensitized with the aid of the brilliant green leads to an increase in the amount of structures (pores) after the irradiation. The experimental results confirm the existence of an earlier-proposed effect of photochemical action on the sensitized cells of adipose tissue that involves additional formation of pores in the membrane of the sensitized cell under selective optical irradiation. The proposed method for the detection of micropores in the membrane of adipose tissue based on the detection of the cytoplasm droplets leaking from the cell can be considered as a method for the optical detection of nano-sized pores. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2013.",,"Adipose tissue; Aqueous alcohols; Brilliant green; Digital microscopy; Optical detection; Optical irradiation; Photochemical action; Sensitized cells; Cells; Cytology; Drops; Irradiation; Membranes; Tissue; Tissue engineering",,,0030400X,,OPSUA,,"English",2-s2.0-84893066866

Therefore, biomaterials to fill dental defects appear to be necessary to fulfill customers' needs regarding the properties and the processing of the products. Bioceramics and glass-ceramics are widely used for these purposes, as dental inlays, onlays, veneers, crowns or bridges. Calcium orthophosphates belong to bioceramics but they have some specific advantages over other types of bioceramics due to a chemical similarity to the inorganic part of both human and mammalian bones and teeth. Therefore, calcium orthophosphates (both alone and as components of various formulations) are used in dentistry as both dental fillers and implantable scaffolds. This review provides brief information on calcium orthophosphates and describes in details current state-of-the-art on their applications in dentistry and dentistry-related fields.

Astralen has been assembled with polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) by the layer-by-layer manner followed by Ag nanoparticle formation by means of a silver mirror reaction, giving the final structure of composite particles CaCO3(PAH/astralen)x/Ag, where x = 1-3. The components of the microparticle carry multiple functionalities: (i) an easy identification by Raman imaging (photostable astralen) and (ii) SERS due to a rough surface of Ag nanoparticles. A combination of Ag and astralen nanoparticles provides an enhancement of astralen Raman signal by more than 1 order of magnitude. Raman signals of commonly used scaffold components such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol as well as ECM component (hyaluronic acid) are significantly enhanced.

The recent findings that regeneration is possible in the heart have made stem cell therapeutics the Holy Grail of modern cardiovascular medicine. The success of cardiac regenerative therapies hinges on the combination of an effective allogeneic "" off the shelf"" cell product with a practical delivery system. In 2007 Medistem discovered the Endometrial Regenerative Cell (ERC), a new mesenchymal-like stem cell. Medistem and subsequently independent groups have demonstrated that ERC are superior to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), the most widely used stem cell source in development. ERC possess robust expansion capability (one donor can generate 20,000 patients doses), key growth factor production and high levels of angiogenic activity. ERC have been published in the peer reviewed literature to be significantly more effect at treating animal models of heart failure (Hida et al. Stem Cells 2008).Current methods of delivering stem cells into the heart suffer several limitations in addition to poor delivery efficiency. Surgical methods are highly invasive, and the classical catheter based techniques are limited by need for sophisticated cardiac mapping systems and risk of myocardial perforation. Medistem together with Dr. Amit Patel Director of Clinical Regenerative Medicine at University of Utah have developed a novel minimally invasive delivery method that has been demonstrated safe and effective for delivery of stem cells (Tuma et al. J Transl Med 2012). Medistem is evaluating the combination of ERC, together with our retrograde delivery procedure in a 60 heart failure patient, double blind, placebo controlled phase II trial. To date 17 patients have been dosed and preliminary analysis by the Data Safety Monitoring Board has allowed for trial continuation.The combined use of a novel "" off the shelf"" cell together with a minimally invasive 30 minute delivery method provides a potentially paradigm-shifting approach to cardiac regenerative therapy. © 2013 Bockeria et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"5' nucleotidase; angiopoietin; beta1 integrin; brain derived neurotrophic factor; CD146 antigen; CD18 antigen; CD59 antigen; CD9 antigen; endoglin; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; Hermes antigen; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; matrix metalloproteinase; neurotrophin 3; octamer transcription factor 4; placebo; platelet derived growth factor BB; stromelysin; telomerase; Thy 1 antigen; vasculotropin; angiogenesis; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; endometrial regenerative cell; endometriosis; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle cell; human; limb ischemia; mesenchymal stem cell; minimally invasive procedure; multiple sclerosis; nonhuman; patient safety; protein expression; protein secretion; regenerative medicine; review; stem cell expansion; stem cell transplantation; therapy effect; Animals; Cell Transplantation; Endometrium; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Models, Animal; Regenerative Medicine",,,14795876,,,23510656,"English",2-s2.0-84874461037

After mixing, both phases form pastes, which set and harden forming either a non-stoichiometric calcium deficient hydroxyapatite or brushite. Since both of them are remarkably biocompartible, bioresorbable and osteoconductive, self-setting calcium orthophosphate formulations appear to be promising bioceramics for bone grafting. Furthermore, such formulations possess excellent molding capabilities, easy manipulation and nearly perfect adaptation to the complex shapes of bone defects, followed by gradual bioresorption and new bone formation. In addition, reinforced formulations have been introduced, which might be described as calcium orthophosphate concretes. The discovery of self-setting properties opened up a new era in the medical application of calcium orthophosphates and many commercial trademarks have been introduced as a result. Currently such formulations are widely used as synthetic bone grafts, with several advantages, such as pourability and injectability. Moreover, their low-temperature setting reactions and intrinsic porosity allow loading by drugs, biomolecules and even cells for tissue engineering purposes.

A correct choice of the thermal treatment parameters should be based on modeling of both radiative transfer and transient heating of human tissues. An adequate computational model should allow prediction of the thermal conversions in the cells of the tissues. A computational analysis based on a general approach developed recently by the authors for indirect heating strategy showed that two-dimensional effects of the radiative transfer are not so important for superficial tumors because of a very high extinction of the incident beam. This enabled us to develop a simplified transient model based on 1-D numerical solution for radiative transfer and 2-D axisymmetrical heat transfer model. A difference between the local temperatures of arterial blood and ambient tissue appears to be also not significant for the soft thermal treatment of superficial tumors. The resulting approximate theoretical model based on 1-D solution for radiative transfer and local thermal equilibrium between blood and tissue makes it possible to study a feedback effect of both thermal and optical properties of partially destroyed human tissues on the parameters of the thermal treatment. It is shown that computational error of the simplified approach for typical superficial tumors is negligible. The numerical study for realistic parameters of human tissues showed that the effects of temperature variation of both thermal and optical properties of the tissues are insignificant. The increase in absorption coefficient of the irradiated healthy tissue with degree of thermal damage also did not have a significant effect on a correct choice of the thermal treatment parameters. However, the role of uncertainty in the local thickness and thermal conductivity of the fat layer may be significant and should be taken into account in thermal treatment of superficial tumors.

This type of materials is of the special significance for the human beings because they represent the inorganic part of major normal (bones, teeth and antlers) and pathological (i.e. those appearing due to various diseases) calcified tissues of mammals. For example, atherosclerosis results in blood vessel blockage caused by a solid composite of cholesterol with calcium orthophosphates. Dental caries and osteoporosis mean a partial decalcification of teeth and bones respectively that results in replacement of a less soluble and harder biological apatite by more soluble and softer calcium hydrogenorthophosphates. Therefore, the processes of both normal and pathological calcifications are just an in vivo crystallization of calcium orthophosphates. Similarly, dental caries and osteoporosis might be considered as in vivo dissolution of calcium orthophosphates. Conversely, due to a great chemical similarity with the biological calcified tissues, many calcium orthophosphates possess remarkable biocompatibility and bioactivity. Materials scientists extensively use this property to construct artificial bone grafts that are either entirely made of or only surface-coated by the biologically relevant calcium orthophosphates. For example, self-setting hydraulic cements made of calcium orthophosphates are helpful in bone repair, while titanium substitutes covered by a surface layer of calcium orthophosphates are used for hip joint endoprostheses and tooth substitutes. Porous scaffolds made of calcium orthophosphates are very promising tools for tissue engineering applications. In addition, calcium orthophosphates of a technical grade are very popular mineral fertilizers. There is a great significance of calcium orthophosphates for the humankind and, in this paper, an overview on the current knowledge on this subject is provided. To assist and guide the readers, a great number of references to the related publications detalizing various specific aspects of the matter has been collected. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We developed an approach to controllable and reversible aggregation of modified cells by their cross-linking in the presence of calcium ion. Resulting aggregates have spherical shape and the size of 100-500 μm. Proposed approaches and methods represent an alternative to cell microencapsulation technique and are of interest for the development of three-dimensional cell models and their delivery in vivo.","Cell microencapsulation; Cell spheroids; Plasma membrane; Polysaccharides; Tissue engineering",,,,1815445X,,,,"Russian",2-s2.0-84871837214

For many years, skin grafting used to serve one of the most important methods to treat large and deep skin lesions. However, a limited availability of the substrate for transplantation restricts wider application of the approach. Utilization of wound covers and skin replacements of various types (including synthetic, biological and biosynthetic ones) provides an alternative. Skin substitutes - biosynthetic covers of the complex structure constitute the most important niche in a wide spectrum of wound covers developed and actively utilized by today. Cell substrates used in the former include dermal fibroblasts, neonatal foreskin fibroblasts and keratinocytes.

To study these reactions, experimental models that enable to evaluate the applied forces and the deformations of the tissues are required. A model based upon the active intrusion of a living early gastrula Xenopus embryo into a tube half the embryo in diameter is described. The intrusion is initially triggered by a suction force of several dozen Pa but then continues in the absence of external driving force, stopping immediately after the entire embryo has penetrated into the tube. The process can be stopped by cytoskeletal drugs or by the damage of the part of the embryo still non-aspirated and is associated with the transversal contraction and meridional elongation of the non-aspirated part of the embryo surface and quasi-periodic longitudinal contractions/extensions of the cells within the part already aspirated.

The electrochemical response was well correlated with cell viability, intracellular ATP level and induction of apoptosis, as determined by independent assays. Developed sensors allow for robust and cost-effective assessment of ATP in cells in contrast to enzyme-based electrodes and conventional bioluminescent assay. Results can be used for rapid analysis of human cells for the purpose of medical diagnostics, transplantology, and toxicological screening.

We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2 and KEAP1 in 34%, squamous differentiation genes in 44%, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway genes in 47%, and CDKN2A and RB1 in 72% of tumours.

We explore the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance using aquatic invertebrates as an example and demonstrate that using key parameters of energy balance (aerobic scope for growth, reproduction and activity; tissue energy status; metabolic rate depression; and compensatory onset of anaerobiosis) can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and their interactions and in predicting the whole-organism and population-level consequences of environmental stress. We argue that limitations of both the amount of available energy and the rates of its acquisition and metabolic conversions result in trade-offs between basal maintenance of a stressed organism and energy costs of fitness-related functions such as reproduction, development and growth and can set limit to the tolerance of a broad range of environmental stressors. The degree of stress-induced disturbance of energy balance delineates transition from moderate stress compatible with population persistence (pejus range) to extreme stress where only time-limited existence is possible (pessimum range). It also determines the predominant adaptive strategy of metabolic responses (energy compensation vs. conservation) that allows an organism to survive the disturbance. We propose that energy-related biomarkers can be used to determine the conditions when these metabolic transitions occur and thus predict ecological consequences of stress exposures. Bioenergetic considerations can also provide common denominator for integrating stress responses and predicting tolerance limits under the environmentally realistic scenarios when multiple and often variable stressors act simultaneously on an organism. Determination of bioenergetic sustainability at the organism's level (or lack thereof) has practical implications. It can help identify the habitats and/or conditions where a population can survive (even if at the cost of reduced reproduction and growth) and those that are incapable of supporting viable populations. Such an approach will assist in explaining and predicting the species' distribution limits in the face of the environmental change and informing the conservation efforts and resource management practices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerobic scope; Bioenergetics; Energy metabolism; Marine invertebrates; Metabolic markers; Multiple stressors; Stress tolerance","Aerobic scope; Bioenergetics; Energy metabolism; Marine invertebrates; Metabolic markers; Multiple stressors; Stress tolerance; Animals; Biochemistry; Conservation; Ecology; Energy balance; Forecasting; Marine engineering; Physiology; Population statistics; Tissue; Metabolism; adenosine triphosphate; aquatic organism; bioenergetics; biomarker; energy balance; environmental stress; homeostasis; invertebrate; metabolism; population distribution; acidification; anaerobic growth; aquatic species; article; basal metabolic rate; bioenergy; energy balance; energy conservation; energy cost; energy metabolism; environmental change; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental stress; environmental temperature; enzyme synthesis; human; nonhuman; prediction; protein degradation; protein expression; resource management; salinity; species distribution; species habitat; temperature stress; water pollution; Animals; Biological Markers; Ecology; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Homeostasis; Invertebrates; Stress, Physiological; Invertebrata",,,01411136,,MERSD,22622075,"English",2-s2.0-84863882895

Here, we compared two porous scaffolds made from different silk proteins, fibroin of Bombyx mori and a recombinant analog of Nephila clavipes spidroin 1 known as rS1/9, and their biocompatibility and degradation behavior in vitro and in vivo. The vascularization and intergrowth of the connective tissue, which was penetrated with nerve fibers, at 8 weeks after subcutaneous implantation in Balb/c mice was more profound using the rS1/9 scaffolds. Implantation of both scaffolds into bone defects in Wistar rats accelerated repair compared to controls with no implanted scaffold at 4 weeks. Based on the number of macrophages and multinuclear giant cells in the subcutaneous area and the number of osteoclasts in the bone, regeneration was determined to be more effective after the rS1/9 scaffolds were implanted. Microscopic examination of the morphology of the matrices revealed differences in their internal microstructures. In contrast to fibroin-based scaffolds, the walls of the rS1/9 scaffolds were visibly thicker and contained specific micropores.

Isotropic and macroporous hydrogels based on poly(vinyl alcohol) acrylic derivative (Acr-PVA) and also macroporous epoxy groups containing hydrogels synthesized by copolymerization of this macromer and glycidyl methacrylate, have been used in this study. Isotropic hydrogels were prepared at positive temperatures while macroporous ones were obtained by formation in cryo-conditions. The peptide was entrapped into macroporous PVA hydrogels by adding the peptide solution onto preformed matrices, while peptide immobilization on PVA-GMA hydrogels, containing free epoxy groups, was carried out by sorption of peptide from its aqueous solution. In the case of DSIP entrapment into isotropic PVA gel the peptide solution was added into the polymer mixture at hydrogel formation. The kinetics of peptide release from hydrogels was studied by incubating matrices in PBS solution (pH 7.4), in physiological solution (0.9% NaCl) and in water. DSIP concentration in supernatants was determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Incubation of macroporous PVA gels in PBS, 0.9% NaCl, and water for 30 min caused release of 74, 70, and 64% DSIP, respectively, and this processes completed within 3 h.

Kholkin, N. Amdursky, I. Bdikin, E. Gazit, and G. Rosenman, ACS Nano 4, 610 (2010) opened up a new perspective for their use as biocompatible nanoactuators, nanomotors, and molecular machines. Another, as yet unexplored functional property is the ability to switch polarization and create artificial polarization patterns useful in various electronic and optical applications. In this work, we demonstrate that diphenylalanine peptide nanotubes are indeed electrically switchable if annealed at a temperature of about 150°C. The new orthorhombic antipolar structure that appears after annealing allows for the existence of a radial polarization component, which is directly probed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurements. Observation of the relatively stable polarization patterns and hysteresis loops via PFM testifies to the local reorientation of molecular dipoles in the radial direction. The experimental results are complemented with rigorous molecular calculations and create a solid background of electric-field induced deformation of aromatic rings and corresponding polarization switching in this emergent material. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",,"Aromatic rings; Bio-surfactants; Di-peptides; Functional properties; Molecular calculations; Molecular dipole; Molecular machines; Nano-scale objects; Nanoactuators; Nanomotors; Nanotemplates; Optical applications; Peptide nanotubes; Piezoresponse force microscopy; Polar property; Polarization patterns; Polarization switching; Radial direction; Radial polarization; Self-assembled peptides; Switchable; Tubular structures; Aromatic compounds; Biosensors; Electric switches; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Optical switches; Polarization; Surface active agents; Tissue engineering; Peptides",,,00218979,,JAPIA,,"English",2-s2.0-84861722882

However, many questions on the role of different signaling pathways in the regulation of stem cell (SC) functional activity within the organism still remain unanswered. In lesion regions the level of cell death increases and DNA fragments from dead cells (cell-free DNA, cfDNA) are accumulated in blood. We have shown that in vitro contact of adipose-derived MSCs with cfDNA fragments the increase of transcription activity (evaluated by the increase of total cellular RNA and rRNA) is observed. GC-rich cfDNA fragments (GC-DNA) activated the TLR9-dependent signal pathway causing up-regulation of expression of TLR9 and MyD88, the TLR9-signaling pathway adapter. AT-rich DNA fragments did not increase the TLR9 expression, but did increase the level of MyD88 mRNA. So we suggest that AT-DNA acts via some other receptors, which, nevertheless, activate MyD88-dependent signalling in MSCs. We have also shown that cfDNA fragments decreased the activity of caspase, an apoptotic enzyme. Thus, cfDNA can significantly influence the functional activity of MSC by activating the TLR9- and MyD88-dependent signal pathways and by lowering the apoptosis level. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012.","apoptosis; cell-free DNA; mesenchymal stem cells; TLR9","bacterial DNA; caspase 3; DNA fragment; messenger RNA; myeloid differentiation factor 88; TATA binding protein; toll like receptor 9; adipose derived stem cell; apoptosis; article; AT rich sequence; cell death; cell free system; cell function; controlled study; DNA probe; enzyme activity; enzyme repression; Escherichia coli; GC rich sequence; gene; gene activation; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; in vitro study; intracellular signaling; mesenchymal stem cell; MyD88 gene; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; regenerative medicine; stem cell transplantation; TBP gene; TLR9 gene; transcription regulation",,,19907508,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84857941940

However, their low surface energy and lack of functional groups to interact with the cellular environment have limited their applications for in vivo studies. Ion beam modification is a convenient method for improving the surface properties of polymeric materials for functional biomedical applications. In the work described here, vacuum arc metal ion implantation was used to modify the composition of the near-surface region of three kinds of polymerspoly(L-lactide), poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide), and poly(L-lactide/caprolactone)chosen as representative of biodegradable polymers.

In general, this concept is determined by advantageous balances of more stable (frequently hydroxyapatite) and more resorbable (typically tricalcium orthophosphates) phases of calcium orthophosphates, while the optimum ratios depend on the particular applications. Therefore, all currently known biphasic, triphasic and multiphasic formulations of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics are sparingly soluble in water and, thus, after being implanted they are gradually resorbed inside the body, releasing calcium and orthophosphate ions into the biological medium and, hence, seeding new bone formation. The available formulations have already demonstrated proven biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, safety and predictability in vitro, in vivo, as well as in clinical models. More recently, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that some of them might possess osteoinductive properties. Hence, in the field of tissue engineering biphasic, triphasic and multiphasic calcium orthophosphates represent promising biomaterials to construct various scaffolds capable of carrying and/or modulating the behavior of cells. Furthermore, such scaffolds are also suitable for drug delivery applications.

A little bit later, such materials were called bioceramics. Initially bioceramics was used as reasonable alternatives to metals in order to increase their biocompatibility. However, within a short period, it has become a diverse class of biomaterials, presently including three essential types: relatively bioinert, bioactive (or surface reactive) and bioresorbable bioceramics. Besides, to provide tissue ingrowth, three-dimensional porous constructions (scaffolds) might be fabricated from any type of bioceramics. This review is limited to bioceramics prepared from calcium orthophosphates only, which belong to the categories of bioactive and bioresorbable compounds. There have been a number of important advances in this field during the past 30 - 40 years. Namely, after initial studies on the development of bioceramics that was just tolerated in the physiological environment, an emphasis was shifted towards the bioceramics that interacted with bones by forming a direct chemical bond. Furthermore, by the structural and compositional control, it became possible to choose whether the calcium orthophosphate bioceramics was biologically stable once incorporated within the skeletal structure or whether it was resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics, which is able to promote a regeneration of bones, has been developed. Current biomedical applications of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics include artificial replacements for hips, knees, teeth, tendons and ligaments, as well as repair for periodontal disease, maxillofacial reconstruction, augmentation and stabilization of the jawbone, spinal fusion and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Potential future applications will include drug delivery systems, as well as calcium orthophosphates will become effective carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and/or various types of cells for tissue engineering purposes. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

MMSCs were obtained from femoral bone marrow aspirate, cultivated during 2-3 passages and marked by lentiviral vectors containing genes encoding green or cherry fluorescent proteins 4-6 days before implantation. The implantation of MMSCs resulted in new bone formation within 12 weeks. Cultured MMSC differentiated into bone, cartilage and other connective tissues in vivo. Mineral matrix used as a carrier of MMSC was completely resorbed in 10 weeks. Implanted MMSCs bearing marking gene maintained newly formed bone and cartilage tissues for at least one year. Thus, cultured MMSCs preserve the ability to differentiate and maintain bone tissue for long-term period in vivo, suggesting their high proliferative potential. Therefore, they could be used in tissue engineering in the healing of large bone defects. © Mamonov et al.","Bone defect; Lentiviral vector; Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells","calcium phosphate; calcium sulfate; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; autotransplantation; bone regeneration; bone tissue; cartilage; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; in vivo study; male; mesenchymal stroma cell; multipotent stem cell; nonhuman; osteolysis; priority journal; radius fracture; surgical technique; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; Oryctolagus cuniculus",,,18750435,,,,"English",2-s2.0-84856530258

In this spectral range there is a sharp growth of optical loss in silica glasses due to an influence of the molecular vibration lasers based on silica based fiber. Therefore to achieve the high lasing efficiency a length of the cavity should be not longer than several meters. It means that Ho-ions concentration should be high enough to provide an efficient oscillation using a short active fiber piece. On the other hand an increase of the active ions concentration can lead to the ions clustering. This effect can decrease the lasing efficiency and cause the laser self-pulsing due to the fast relaxation of the ions in clusters to the ground level.

Costal cartilage is a most suitable natural material for transplantation. The problem is to obtain stable proper shape of cartilage implants. The objective of this article is to study reshaping of porcine costal cartilage for larynx stenosis surgery using Erbium glass fiber laser. Materials and Methods Porcine cartilage plates 3 mm in thickness were mechanically curved and irradiated (1) on one side (stretched or compressed) and (2) on both sides with different sequence. Irradiation was performed using a 1.56 μm laser with power varied from 1 to 2.5 W, exposure time from 5 to 20 seconds, spot diameter of 2.5 mm, pulse duration of 500 milliseconds, pulse repetition rate of 1.4 Hz. For each laser setting, stable curvature radius was measured during 24 hours after the experiment. Irradiated samples were analyzed by means of differential scanning calorimerty (DSC) to reveal the collagen denaturation degree. Results The optimum laser setting for stable reshaping of costal cartilage without visual thermal damage of cartilage matrix was established: laser power of 2.2 W, exposure time of 6 seconds. Nonlinear thermomechanical behavior of cartilage in the course of its laser reshaping is experimentally revealed. The influence of irradiation sequence on the curvature radius of cartilage implant is found for the first time. It is shown that (1) it is possible to use laser reshaping technique for making stable proper shape of costal cartilage, and (2) primary irradiation of compressed side followed with an irradiation of stretched side is more effective than reverse sequence of laser treatment. DSC analysis showed that thermal effect of irradiated specimens (2.58-3.79 J/g) was slightly lower that that for intact cartilage specimens and considerably lower than that for denaturation of collagen (65 ± 5 J/g). Conclusions It is possible to use laser reshaping technique for preparation of stable cartilage implants. Nonlinear thermomechanical behavior of cartilage is experimentally revealed. The influence of irradiation sequence on curvature radius of cartilage grafts is established for the first time. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","cartilage implants; larynx stenosis; laser reshaping; stress relaxation","collagen; animal tissue; article; cartilage graft; cartilage matrix; denaturation; differential scanning calorimetry; erbium YAG laser; larynx stenosis; larynx surgery; laser reshaping; mechanics; nonhuman; phase transition; priority journal; rib cartilage; temperature; tissue engineering; Animals; Cartilage; Laser Therapy; Ribs; Swine",,,01968092,,LSMED,21761421,"English",2-s2.0-79960553482

However, one of the limiting factors in the overall interpretation of clinical results obtained by cell therapy is represented by the lack of three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution methods for the visualization of the injected cells and their fate within the myocardium. This work shows that X-ray computed microtomography may offer the unique possibility of detecting, with high definition and resolution and in ex vivo conditions, the 3D spatial distribution of rat cardiac progenitor cells, labelled with iron oxide nanoparticles, inside the infarcted rat heart early after injection. The obtained 3D images represent a very innovative progress as compared to experimental two-dimensional (2D) histological analysis, which requires time-consuming energies for image reconstruction in order to provide the overall distribution of rat clonogenic cells within the heart. Through microtomography, we were able to observe in 3D the presence of these cells within damaged cardiac tissue, with important structural details that are difficult to visualize by conventional bidimensional imaging techniques. This new 3D-imaging approach appears to be an important way to investigate the cellular events involved in cardiac regeneration and represents a promising tool for future clinical applications. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cardiac progenitor cells; Cell engraftment; Cell migration; Infarcted rat heart; MicroCT; Nanoparticles; Synchrotron radiation; Tissue engineering","iron oxide; nanocrystal; nanoparticle; quantum dot; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell damage; cell homing; cell isolation; cell labeling; cell tracking; clonogenesis; ex vivo study; fluorescence analysis; heart; heart infarction; histology; image reconstruction; male; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; sham procedure; stem cell; three dimensional imaging; two dimensional echocardiography; Animals; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Fluorescence; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Myoblasts, Cardiac; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardium; Paraffin Embedding; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Stem Cell Transplantation; X-Ray Microtomography",,,19326254,,,21360687,"English",2-s2.0-79960564641

In present work a novel combine approach is proposed for preparation of polyvinyl alcohol macroporous hydrogels by cross-linking of polyvinyl alcohol acrylic derivatives in the presence of heterophase of frozen aqueous media. Hydrogels prepared using this method does not need additional structure fixing and are characterized by high thermal stability in swollen state sustaining even heating to more than 100 °C. The influence of different factors and reaction conditions on the cross-linked hydrogel formation process was studied. The high yield of products (80÷95%) was observed when reaction was conducted at temperature range -12÷-18 °C, concentration of macromer 4-12 weight %, and amount of initiator 0.8÷1.6 mg/ml. Moreover, the equilibrium swelling of synthesized macroporous hydrogels was investigated and it was shown that synthesized cross-linked hydrogels are characterized by high water absorption which is weakly depended on solution pH and ionic force values. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cross-linking; Cryogel; Hydrogel; Macroporous; Polyvinyl alcohol; Swelling","Acrylic derivatives; Additional structures; Aqueous media; Broad application; Cross-linked hydrogels; Cryogels; Equilibrium swelling; High thermal stability; High yield; Ionic forces; Macromers; Macroporous; Macroporous hydrogels; Polymeric hydrogels; Reaction conditions; Solution pH; Temperature range; Polymers; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Water absorption; Hydrogels",,,10229760,,JPORE,,"English",2-s2.0-79959762527

Lowering the solvent quality, and eventual brush collapse, reduce the osmotic pressure at height z within the brush, Π(z), and with it the associated free energy penalty of inserting a particle into the brush, Fins(z). Brush collapse thus favors penetration into the brush and adsorption within it, an effect utilized in tissue engineering, chromatography etc. In the self-consistent field theory of brushes, the effect reflects both the amplitude and form of Π(z). For good, Θ, and poor solvents, denoted by i = g, Θ, and p, the Π(z) profile is Πi(z) = Πi(0)uimi where Hi is the brush height and ui = 1 - z2/Hi2. The analysis utilizes the known mg = 2, mΘ = 3/2 as well as the derived m p = 1 together with Πp(0)/Πg(0) ∼ Hp/Hg and ΠΘ(0)/Πg(0) ∼ HΘ/Hg.

A goldplated mirror was fixed beneath the tissue and percentage clearing was determined by measuring the change in intensity of optical coherence tomography light returning from the mirror over time.

Many models for this estimation have been built, such as Monte Carlo simulation, diffusion models, and the differential modified Beer-Lambert law. The optimization-based methods are too slow for chromophore mapping of high-resolution spectral images, and the differential modified Beer-Lambert is not often accurate enough. Optimal coefficients for the differential Beer-Lambert model are calculated by differentiating the diffusion model, optimized to the normal skin spectrum. The derivatives are then used in predicting the difference in chromophore concentrations from the difference in absorption spectra. The accuracy of the method is tested both computationally and experimentally using a Monte Carlo multilayer simulation model, and the data are measured from the palm of a hand during an Allen's test, which modulates the blood content of skin. The correlations of the given and predicted blood, melanin, and oxygen saturation levels are correspondingly r = 0.94, r = 0.99, and r = 0.73.

These studies of SC resulted in several original hypotheses explaining their unusual features. Impressive progress recently achieved in this direction (2008-2010) is associated with employment of new methods of somatic recombination for long-term registration of various strains of differentiated cells, early and distant SC progeny. 1) Although anatomic localization of intestinal epithelium cells lacking marked morphological and biochemical differentiation markers (the lower third of intestinal and colon crypts) is known for about 40 years results of their experimental identification, isolation and detection of their functional characteristics still represent the subject for discussions. Particularly, it remains unclear, which SC are involved in crypt regeneration: the same as those involved into homeostatic renewal or their various subpopulations or early SC progenies acquired stem features by reprogramming? 2) In addition, most detected biochemical markers of potential SC are common for SC from other tissues of embryonic and mature organisms so it is possible to apply method developed for intestinal epithelium for their isolation. 3) Data on induction of intestinal epithelium polyps and neoplasias by mutations in genes encoding SC markers and identification of biochemical characteristics of potential SC in these tumors support the hypothesis of stem tumor cell origination from normal SC or their earliest progeny. In general, facts considered in this review may be useful for both development of optimal methods for the use of SC in cell therapy (as the source of humoral factors), regenerative medicine (as the source of differentiated cells for restoration of injured tissue), and also for targeted search of antitumor drugs (SC as the target) and preparations modifying genetic and epigenetic reactions of SC to genotoxic and stress treatments. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","intestinal epithelium; markers; stem cells","beta1 integrin; BMI1 protein; bone morphogenetic protein receptor; DNA; doublecortin and calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase like I; ephrin receptor B2; ephrin receptor B3; G protein coupled receptor; leucine rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptor 5; membrane protein; microtubule associated protein; molecular marker; Musashi 1; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; prominin; RNA binding protein; telomerase reverse transcriptase; unclassified drug; article; biochemistry; cell differentiation; cell function; cell isolation; cell regeneration; cell renewal; cell strain; cell structure; cell subpopulation; cellular distribution; DNA modification; Drosophila melanogaster; gene mutation; human; intestine cancer; intestine crypt; intestine epithelium cell; intestine epithelium stem cell; intestine polyp; mitotic recombination; nonhuman; priority journal; regenerative medicine; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; tissue regeneration; Drosophila melanogaster; Homo sapiens",,,19907508,,,,"English",2-s2.0-79954463211

The salt leaching technique was used to make the rS1/9 scaffolds of interconnected macroporous structure with spontaneously formed micropores. The tensile strength of scaffolds was 18 ± 5 N/cm2. Scaffolds were relatively stable in a phosphate buffer but degraded in oxidizing environment after 11 weeks of incubation. Applicability of the recombinant spidroin 1 as a substrate for cell culture was demonstrated by successful 3T3 cells growth on the surface of rS1/9 films (270 ± 20 cells/mm2 vs. 97 ± 8 cells/mm2 on the glass surface, p &lt; 0.01). The 3T3 fibroblasts readily proliferated within the rS1/9 scaffold (from initially plated 19 ± 2 cells/mm3 to 3800 ± 304 cells/mm 3 after 2 weeks). By this time, cells were uniformly distributed between the surface and deeper layers (27% ± 8% and 33% ± 4%, respectively; p &gt; 0.05), whereas the initial distribution was 58% ± 7% and 11% ± 8%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). The rS1/9 scaffolds implanted subcutaneously into Balb/c mice were well tolerated. Over a 2-month period, the scaffolds promoted an ingrowth of de novo formed vascularized connective tissue elements and nerve fibers.

Cells maintain a complete set of functionally competent proteins normally and in the face of injury or environmental stress with the use of various mechanisms, including systems of proteins called molecular chaperones. Proteins that are denatured by any form of proteotoxic stress are cooperatively recognized by heat shock proteins (HSP) and directed for refolding or degradation. Under non-denaturing conditions HSP have important functions in cell physiology such as in transmembrane protein transport and in enabling assembly and folding of newly synthesized polypeptides. Besides cellular molecular chaperones, which are stress-induced proteins, there have been recently reported chemical, or so-called pharmacological chaperones with demonstrated ability to be effective in preventing misfolding of different disease-causing proteins, specifically in the therapeutic management of sight-threatening eye diseases, essentially reducing the severity of several neurodegenerative disorders (such as age-related macular degeneration), cataract and many other protein-misfolding diseases.

The respiratory tract contains several sources of endogenous adult stem cells residing within the basal layer of the upper airways, within or near pulmonary neuroendocrine cell rests, at the bronchoalveolar junction, and within the alveolar epithelial surface, which contribute to the repair of the airway wall. Bone marrow-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells circulating in blood are also involved in tracheal regeneration. However, an organism is frequently incapable of repairing serious damage and defects of the respiratory tract resulting from acute trauma, lung cancers, and chronic pulmonary and airway diseases. Therefore, replacement of the tracheal tissue should be urgently considered. The shortage of donor trachea remains a major obstacle in tracheal transplantation. However, implementation of tissue engineering and stem cell therapy-based approaches helps to successfully solve this problem. To date, huge progress has been achieved in tracheal bioengineering. Several sources of stem cells have been used for transplantation and airway reconstitution in animal models with experimentally induced tracheal defects. Most tracheal tissue engineering approaches use biodegradable three-dimensional scaffolds, which are important for neotracheal formation by promoting cell attachment, cell redifferentiation, and production of the extracellular matrix. The advances in tracheal bioengineering recently resulted in successful transplantation of the world's first bioengineered trachea. Current trends in tracheal transplantation include the use of autologous cells, development of bioactive cell-free scaffolds capable of supporting activation and differentiation of host stem cells on the site of injury, with a future perspective of using human native sites as micro-niche for potentiation of the human body's site-specific response by sequential adding, boosting, permissive, and recruitment impulses. © 2010 Chistiakov; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"aggrecan; collagen type 11; collagen type 2; collagen type 6; collagen type 9; decorin; fibromodulin; fibronectin; hyaluronic acid; integrin; tissue scaffold; adult stem cell; amniotic fluid cell; bioengineering; cartilage cell; cartilage graft; cell adhesion; cell dedifferentiation; cell free system; cellular distribution; epithelium cell; extracellular matrix; human; mesenchymal stem cell; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein protein interaction; respiratory epithelium; review; stem cell transplantation; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; trachea; trachea injury; transplantation; umbilical cord blood; animal; cytology; epithelium cell; lung; methodology; physiology; regenerative medicine; trachea; transplantation; wound healing; Animalia; Adult Stem Cells; Animals; Bioengineering; Epithelial Cells; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Lung; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Transplantation; Tissue Engineering; Trachea; Wound Healing",,,10217770,,JBCIE,21138559,"English",2-s2.0-78649728792

Problem of the covering of large burned surfaces is still a challenge. In present study, a novel electrospun nanofibrous material is proposed as a new material for burn dressing. Versatility of electrospinning nanofiber manufacturing method allows developing various types of micro- and nanofiber materials from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, including chitosan. Samples of chitosan nanofiber mats were created and tested as wound dressings for IIIa and IIIb degree burns. It is shown that chitosan nanofiber dressings provide effective absorbtion of exudate, ventilation of the wound, protection from infection and stimulate the process of skin tissue regeneration. Degradation of these materials prevents mechanical damage of wound during removing. The influence of thickness of materials on regenerative processes and degradation is studied.

Two routes for producing these structures were designed based on templating of: (i) air bubbles and (ii) anisotropic microcrystals of calcium carbonate with living cells, which allowed us to fabricate celloidosomes of spherical, rhombohedral and needle-like morphologies. Air microbubbles were templated by yeast cells coated with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), then coated with carboxymethylcellulose and rehydrated resulting in the formation of spherical multicellular structures. Similarly, calcium carbonate microcrystals of anisotropic shapes were coated with several consecutive layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to obtain a positive surface charge which was used to immobilise yeast cells coated with anionic polyelectrolyte of their surfaces. After dissolving of sacrificial cores, hollow multicellular structures were obtained. The viability of the cells in the produced structures was confirmed by using fluorescein diacetate. In order to optimize the separation of celloidosomes from free cells magnetic nanoparticles were immobilised onto the surface of templates prior to the cells deposition, which greatly facilitated the separation using a permanent magnet. Two alternative approaches were developed to form celloidosome structures using magnetically functionalised core-shell microparticles which resulted in the formation of celloidosomes with needle-like and cubic-like geometries which follows the original morphology of the calcium carbonate microcrystals. Our methods for fabrication of celloidosomes may found applications in the development of novel symbiotic bio-structures, artificial multicellular organisms and in tissue engineering. The unusual structure of celloidosomes resembles the primitive forms of multicellular species, like Volvox, and other algae and could be regarded as one possible mechanism of the evolutionary development of multicellularity. © 2010 the Owner Societies.",,"calcium carbonate; carboxymethylcellulose; nanoparticle; polyallylamine; polyamine; tissue scaffold; air; article; chemistry; colloid; crystallization; cytology; magnetism; methodology; microbubble; microcapsule; tissue engineering; yeast; Air; Calcium Carbonate; Capsules; Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium; Colloids; Crystallization; Magnetics; Microbubbles; Nanoparticles; Polyamines; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Yeasts",,,14639076,,PPCPF,20737085,"English",2-s2.0-77957158940

Herzen Moscow Oncological Research Institute, Moscow, Russian Federation","Background: Tissue specific promoters may be utilized for a variety of applications, including programmed gene expression in cell types, tissues and organs of interest, for developing different cell culture models or for use in gene therapy. We report a novel, tissue-specific promoter that was identified and engineered from the native upstream regulatory region of the human gene NDUFV1 containing an endogenous retroviral sequence.Results: Among seven established human cell lines and five primary cultures, this modified NDUFV1 upstream sequence (mNUS) was active only in human undifferentiated germ-derived cells (lines Tera-1 and EP2102), where it demonstrated high promoter activity (~twice greater than that of the SV40 early promoter, and comparable to the routinely used cytomegaloviral promoter). To investigate the potential applicability of the mNUS promoter for biotechnological needs, a construct carrying a recombinant cytosine deaminase (RCD) suicide gene under the control of mNUS was tested in cell lines of different tissue origin. High cytotoxic effect of RCD with a cell-death rate ~60% was observed only in germ-derived cells (Tera-1), whereas no effect was seen in a somatic, kidney-derived control cell line (HEK293). In further experiments, we tested mNUS-driven expression of a hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB100X). The mNUS-SB100X construct mediated stable transgene insertions exclusively in germ-derived cells, thereby providing further evidence of tissue-specificity of the mNUS promoter.Conclusions: We conclude that mNUS may be used as an efficient promoter for tissue-specific gene expression in human germ-derived cells in many applications. Our data also suggest that the 91 bp-long sequence located exactly upstream NDUFV1 transcriptional start site plays a crucial role in the activity of this gene promoter in vitro in the majority of tested cell types (10/12), and an important role - in the rest two cell lines. © 2010 Kuzmin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Cell lines; Cell types; Control-cell; Cytotoxic effects; Gene promoter; Germ cells; HEK-293; Human cell lines; Human genes; In-cell; In-vitro; Primary culture; Promoter activities; Regulatory regions; Sleeping beauty; Tissue-specific gene expression; Tissue-specific promoter; Transgene; Transposase; Upstream sequence; Animal cell culture; Cells; Gene expression; Gene therapy; Genetic engineering; Population statistics; Tissue; Cell culture; cytosine deaminase; NDUFV1 protein; protein; sleeping beauty 1000X; transposase; unclassified drug; NDUFV1 protein, human; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; article; cell death; cell differentiation; controlled study; Cytomegalovirus; cytotoxicity; embryo; gene construct; gene expression; gene insertion; gene sequence; genetic engineering; genetic transcription; germ cell; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; kidney cell; male; promoter region; Retrovirus; Simian virus 40; suicide gene; suicide gene therapy; tissue specificity; transgene; antibody specificity; comparative study; gene transfer; genetic engineering; genetics; metabolism; methodology; molecular cloning; suicide transgene; transposon; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cloning, Molecular; DNA Transposable Elements; Gene Expression; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genes, Transgenic, Suicide; Genetic Engineering; Germ Cells; Humans; NADH Dehydrogenase; Organ Specificity; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transgenes",,,14726750,,BBMIE,20716342,"English",2-s2.0-77955542490

The aim of this paper is to outline the role of the additional component DCPD during a transformation/crystallization processes. Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy techniques were used for in situ monitoring of the processes taking place in the system in real time. Morphological investigations were performed applying the scanning electron microscopy technique. Several OCP-DCPD combinations were investigated: (1) 100% OCP; (2) 70% OCP-30% DCPD; (3) 100% DCPD. The obtained experimental results allowed us to conclude that when only OCP is present in SBF, the formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite takes place, whereas for the OCP-DCPD (30%) system in SBF, less kinetically favorable hydroxyapatite (HA) is formed. The additional component (DCPD) influences significantly the structural behavior of hydroxyapatite, acting as the HA crystallization inhibition agent.

Used initially as alternatives to metals in order to increase a biocompatibility of implants, bioceramics have become a diverse class of biomaterials, presently including three basic types: relatively bioinert ceramics, bioactive (or surface reactive) and bioresorbable ones. Furthermore, any type of bioceramics could be porous to provide tissue ingrowth.

In this study we compare the effect of diabetes on scaffold vascularization following SC implantation into diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Wide pore agarose cryogel scaffolds with grafted gelatin were prepared by a two-step freezing procedure and subsequent thawing. The scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously into streptozoticin-induced diabetic mice and control, non-diabetic mice. The vascularization process was estimated using histological sections, in which endothelial cells were identified by Von Willebrand factor (vWF) and CD31 antigen staining and the pericyte layer was confirmed by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) visualization. Comparative analysis showed a similar thickness of fibrous capsules around the vascularized scaffolds in both diabetic and non-diabetic animals. Intensive staining for α-SMA indicated the formation of mature blood vessels in the surrounding fibrous capsule and tissue invading the scaffold area. No statistically significant differences in capillary density and area occupied by blood vessels were found between diabetic and non-diabetic mice.

Namely, it is well established that the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals are nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates in the form of apatites. In mammals, tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological apatite have been found to be combined into self-assembled structures under the control of bioorganic matrixes. Therefore, application and prospective use of the nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are also well known. For example, greater viability and better proliferation of various types of cells have been detected on smaller crystals of calcium orthophosphates. Thus, the nanosized and nanocrystalline forms of calcium orthophosphates have great potential to revolutionize the hard tissue-engineering field, starting from bone repair and augmentation to controlled drug delivery systems.

Titanium alloys are considered the most prospective and extended materials for implants in traumatology, orthopedics, and stomatology. The trend over the last decade has been to exclude alloying components that may cause local allergic reactions on living tissues or general toxic effects on an organism from the structure of titanium alloys. One compromise to preserve high biochemical compatibility with the necessary increase in the mechanical properties of titanium alloys is based on the formation of submicrocrystalline (SMC) or nanostructured (NS) states in commercially pure titanium. The prospect of using SMC and NS titanium as a material for manufacturing implants is proven. An analysis of the results of experimental and theoretical research of the diffusion features on intergranular areas is carried out, and the role of diffusion-controlled processes in the formation of a microstructure of metals and alloys, as well as the microstructured state, is discussed. The efficiency of computer simulation on an atomic level in establishing the dependence of diffusion characteristics on intergranular areas from the average grain size and the structural state of internal boundaries of section is proven. A short description of simulation and semi-industrial methods of the formation of SMC and NS states in metals and alloys by means of severe plastic deformation-which are known as materials related to the ""top-down approach,"" assuming the initial structure is crushed to nanosized components-is presented. Special attention is given to the recent developed of low-cost and high-efficiency technological schemes for the mass production of nanostructured titanium alloys for medical purposes, including radial-shift and screw rollings, along with a combination of traditional methods of mechanical-thermal processing, which make it possible to receive an assortment of the titanium and its alloys necessary for the mass production of medical implants and tools. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2009.",,"Allergic reactions; Alloying components; Atomic levels; Average grain size; Bioactive coatings; Biochemical compatibility; Biomechanical compatibility; Commercially Pure titaniums; Diffusion characteristics; High efficiency; Industrial methods; Initial structures; Intergranular; Internal boundary; Living tissues; Mass production; Material choice; Medical implants; Metals and alloys; Nano-structured; Nanosized components; Nanostructured titanium; Role of diffusion; Severe plastic deformations; Shift-and; Structural state; Submicrocrystalline; Technological scheme; Theoretical research; Thermal processing; Top-down approach; Toxic effect; Traumatology; Alloys; Biomechanics; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Functional materials; Implants (surgical); Machine tools; Mechanical properties; Metallurgy; Production engineering; Textures; Titanium; Titanium alloys",,,19950780,,,,"English",2-s2.0-78651562523

Further, the detailed kinetics studies on Skelite™ scaffolds implanted for different length of times from 3 days to 24 weeks, revealed in the X-ray absorption histograms two separate peaks associated to HA and TCP. It was therefore possible to observe that the progressive degradation of the Skelite™ scaffolds was mainly due to the resorption of TCP.

This type of materials is of the special significance for the human beings because they represent the inorganic part of major normal (bones, teeth and antlers) and pathological (i.e. those appearing due to various diseases) calcified tissues of mammals. For example, atherosclerosis results in blood vessel blockage caused by a solid composite of cholesterol with calcium orthophosphates. Dental caries and osteoporosis mean a partial decalcification of teeth and bones respectively that results in replacement of a less soluble and harder biological apatite by more soluble and softer calcium hydrogenorthophosphates. Therefore, the processes of both normal and pathological calcifications are just an in vivo crystallization of calcium orthophosphates. Similarly, dental caries and osteoporosis might be considered as in vivo dissolution of calcium orthophosphates. Conversely, due to a great chemical similarity with the biological calcified tissues, many calcium orthophosphates possess remarkable biocompatibility and bioactivity. Materials scientists extensively use this property to construct artificial bone grafts that are either entirely made of or only surface-coated by the biologically relevant calcium orthophosphates. For example, self-setting hydraulic cements made of calcium orthophosphates are helpful in bone repair, while titanium substitutes covered by a surface layer of calcium orthophosphates are used for hip joint endoprostheses and tooth substitutes. Porous scaffolds made of calcium orthophosphates are very promising tools for tissue engineering applications. In addition, calcium orthophosphates of a technical grade are very popular mineral fertilizers. There is a great significance of calcium orthophosphates for the humankind and, in this paper, an overview on the current knowledge on this subject is provided. To assist and guide the readers, a great number of references to the related publications detalizing various specific aspects of the matter has been collected. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Namely, the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals are nanodimensional and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates (in the form of apatites) of a biological origin. In mammals, tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological apatite were found to be combined into self-assembled structures under the control of various bioorganic matrixes. In addition, the structures of both dental enamel and bones could be mimicked by an oriented aggregation of nanosized calcium orthophosphates, determined by the biomolecules. The application and prospective use of nanodimensional and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are also known. For example, a greater viability and a better proliferation of various types of cells were detected on smaller crystals of calcium orthophosphates. Thus, the nanodimensional and nanocrystalline forms of calcium orthophosphates have a great potential to revolutionize the field of hard tissue engineering starting from bone repair and augmentation to the controlled drug delivery devices. This paper reviews current state of knowledge and recent developments of this subject starting from the synthesis and characterization to biomedical and clinical applications.

To functionalise the surface of HAP that is in direct contact with human cells a surface electrical charge deposition has been achieved by means of hydrogenation technology. This technology provides uniform 3 dimensioned processing of the specimen surfaces. The engineered charge was estimated from measurements of the photoelectron emission work function (φ). The later was increased to ∼ 0.2 eV. The negatively charged HAP surface attached 10 times more osteoblatic cells and increased their proliferation capacity 1.6 times, in contrast to the uncharged one. The above increment of φ had an effect on the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cell pool (MSCP) immobilized on the calcium phosphate (CP) coatings.

The paper considers physical processes and mechanisms of laser regeneration, presents results of investigations aimed to optimize laser settings and to develop feedback control system for laser reconstruction of spine discs. Possible mechanisms of laser-induced regeneration include: (1) Space and temporary modulated laser beam induces nonhomogeneous and pulse repetitive thermal expansion and stress in the irradiated zone of cartilage. Mechanical effect due to controllable thermal expansion of the tissue and micro and nano gas bubbles formation in the course of the moderate (up to 45-50 oC) heating of the NP activate biological cells (chondrocytes) and promote cartilage regeneration. (2) Nondestructive laser radiation leads to the formation of nano and micro-pores in cartilage matrix. That promotes water permeability and increases the feeding of biological cells. Results provide the scientific and engineering basis for the novel low-invasive laser procedures to be used in orthopedics for the treatment cartilages of spine and joints. The technology and equipment for laser reconstruction of spine discs have been tested first on animals, and then in a clinical trial.

For this purpose, a glass belonging to the system SiO2-P2O5-CaO-MgO-Na2O-K2O (CEL2) was used. The sponge-replication method was adopted to prepare the scaffolds; specifically, a polymeric skeleton was impregnated with a slurry containing CEL2 powder, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binding agent and distilled water. The impregnated sponge was then thermally treated to remove the polymeric phase and to sinter the inorganic one. The obtained scaffolds possessed an open and interconnected porosity, analogous to cancellous bone texture, and with a mechanical strength above 2 MPa. Moreover, the scaffolds underwent partial bioresorption due to ion-leaching phenomena. This feature was investigated by X-ray computed microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT is a three-dimensional (3-D) radiographic imaging technique, able to achieve a spatial resolution close to 1 μm3. The use of synchrotron radiation allows the selected photon energy to be tuned to optimize the contrast among the different phases in the investigated samples. The 3-D scaffolds were soaked in a simulated body fluid (SBF) to study the formation of hydroxyapatite microcrystals on the scaffold struts and on the internal pore walls.

The probability density function of all attenuation coefficients related to the macroporous space inside the scaffold gives access to the tomograph-specific machine error included in the SRμCT measurements (also referred to as instrumental resolution function). After Lorentz function-based clearing of the measured CT data from the systematic resolution error, the voxel-specific attenuation information of the voxels representing the solid skeleton is translated into the composition of the material inside one voxel, in terms of the nanoporosity embedded in a dense CEL2 glass-ceramic matrix. Based on voxel-invariant elastic properties of dense CEL2 glass-ceramic, continuum micromechanics allows for translation of the voxel-specific nanoporosity into voxel-specific elastic properties. They serve as input for Finite Element analyses of the scaffold structure. Young's modulus of a specific CT-scanned macroporous scaffold sample, predicted from a Finite Element simulation of a uniaxial compression test, agrees well with the experimental value obtained from an ultrasonic test on the same sample.

A deviation from the physiological conditions, like e.g. a deficiency of water and salt content, in the cartilage tissue has long been suspected to be a possible trigger for rheumatoid diseases. Progresses in understanding the frictional-compressive behavior on the molecular level have been hindered due to the lack of reliable experimental data and the multitude of controlling parameters, influencing the structure and properties of cartilage tissue in its natural environment. In this paper we study the thermodynamic response of aqueous chondroitin sulfate solutions to changes in the monomer and added salt concentrations, using a recently developed field-theoretic approach beyond the mean field (MF) level of approximation. Our approach relies on the method of Gaussian equivalent representation, which has recently been shown to provide reliable thermodynamic information for polyelectrolyte solutions without and with added salt over the whole range of monomer concentrations. We compare our calculation results to experimental as well as molecular modeling data, and demonstrate that it provides useful estimates for important thermodynamic properties. Moreover, we obtain conclusive insights about the hydration effects and counterion behavior under various conditions, which show that, at the physiological salt concentration, CS solutions have optimal compressive and tribological properties. Finally, our work provides support for the possibility that a long-term deviation from the physiological conditions may trigger rheumatoid diseases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is synthesized by a couple of major ampullate glands in spiders and comprises of two major structural proteins-spidroins 1 and 2. The relationship between structure and mechanical properties of spider silk is not well understood. Here, we modeled the complete process of the spider silk assembly using two new recombinant analogs of spidroins 1 and 2. The artificial genes sequence of the hydrophobic core regions of spidroin 1 and 2 have been designed using computer analysis of existing databases and mathematical modeling. Both proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using a cation exchange chromatography. Despite the absence of hydrophilic N- and C-termini, both purified proteins spontaneously formed the nanofibrils and round micelles of about 1 μm in aqueous solutions. The electron microscopy study has revealed the helical structure of a nanofibril with a repeating motif of 40 nm.

The experimental results indicated that compression strength and microhardness values of HA-Sr-oxide composites decrease when the content of SrCO3 and sintering temperature increase. The best compression strength values were achieved after sintering at 1000°C. It was seen that at higher temperatures the compression strength and the microhardness values decrease due to the pore formation.

The studied micro-CP coatings, characterized by marked roughness of surface had an osteoinductive potential up to 100 %. Relief of CP coatings from HAP nanoparticles (30-50 nm) does not practically differ from ones designed by use of HAP microparticles. Roughness of all CP nanocoatings had average Ra=5.13-6.43 μm and Rz=18.71-24.16 μm that was corresponded to CP microcoatings one. Probability of bone plate formation on CP nanostructured coatings was only 12.5 %. Hydrogenation of the CP surface layer increased its negative charge that was evaluated by means of photoelectron work function (φ) measurement. An increment of φ at the values of ∼0.1-1 eV was supplied. This had an effect on the directions of MSCP differentiation. For example, connective tissue growth was improved. For all this, probability of following ossification with growth of membrane reticulated bone was 20 %. Vice versa, decrease of φ led to primary formation of bone from bone marrow MSCP.

The state of these cells is regulated by biochemical substances, mechanical stimuli and cellular interactions. To estimate gravity effects we used two types of cultured stem cells: human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow and mice embryonic stem (mESC) line R1. Gravity changes were simulated by long-term (4-7 days) slow clinorotation and leaded to decreased hMSC proliferation, changes of cell morphology and modified F-actin cytoskeleton. We did not find the shifts in cell phenotype except for decreased expression of HLA 1 and CD105 but excretion of IL-6 into medium increased significantly. Remodeling of cytoskeleton started after first 4 h and was similar to preapoptotic changes. This data suggested the modification in cell adhesion and possible commitment of hMSC. It was observed that expression of alkaline phosphatase by MSC in osteogenic medium was more intensive in control. On the contrary, clinorotation did not change formation of mESC colonies and increased proliferation activity in LIF+-medium. However, the number of embryonic bodies after clinorotation was less than in static control. It is suggested that ESCs kept the viability and proliferative potential but decreased the differentiation ability after changes in gravity stimulation. © 2008.",,"Adhesion; Biochemical engineering; Biotechnology; Cell adhesion; Cell culture; Extractive metallurgy; Gravitation; Gravitational effects; Mechanics; Microfluidics; Pressure effects; Tissue; Alkaline phosphatase (ALPase); biochemical substances; Bone marrow (BM); Cell morphology; Cellular interactions; Clinorotation; Cytoskeleton (CSK); Embryonic stem (ES); F actin; Gravity changes; Gravity effects; In control; In-cell; mechanical stimulus; Mesenchymal stromal cells; osteogenic medium; Precursor cells; Proliferation activity; Regeneration (renovating); Stem cells; Two types; Cells",,,00945765,,AASTC,,"English",2-s2.0-46649116485

It has been well documented that in situ stress contrast is the dominant parameter controlling fracture height growth, and that Young's modulus contrast is less important. However, a recent study pointed out that modulus contrast can have significant implications on fracture geometry and proppant placement (Smith et al. 2001). To expand on this topic, we consider the combined effects of modulus contrast and in situ stress contrast on fracture geometry. A pseudo 3D (P3D) hydraulic fracture simulator with a rigorous layered modulus formulation is used in this study. The fracture height calculated based on uniform modulus vs. layered modulus, under the same in situ stress contrast conditions, is compared. The results are analyzed and explained, based on fracture mechanics fundamentals as well as the coupled fluid pressure effect in hydraulic fracturing. One important finding is that low-modulus layers can also contain fracture height. The results from this study can be applied to hydraulic fracturing treatments in formations with moderate to significant modulus contrast. The mechanisms studied in this work can also partially explain some recent results from microseismic or tiltmeter mapping that show more fracture height containment than that predicted by commonly used P3D hydraulic fracturing simulators based on averaged modulus.

Recently, we reported a strong cytotoxic effect exhibited by M2 on mammalian cells in vitro. Here we demonstrated a decrease in protection when M2 was added to a DNA vaccination regimen that included influenza NP. Furthermore, we have constructed several fusion proteins of conserved genes of influenza virus and tested their expression in vitro and protective potential in vivo. The four-partite NP-M1-M2-NS1 fusion antigen that has M2 sequence engineered in the middle part of the composite protein was shown to not be cytotoxic in vitro. A three-partite fusion protein (consisting of NP, M1 and NS1) was expressed much more efficiently than the four-partite protein. Both of these constructs provided statistically significant protection upon DNA vaccination, with construct NP-M1-M2-NS1 being the most effective. We conclude that incorporation of M2 into a vaccination regimen may be beneficial only when its apparent cytotoxicity-linked negative effects are neutralized.

Moreover, the KM approach is a good approximation of the general radiative transport equation in the case of 1D theoretical tasks. But it is well known that the KM model doesn't allow anyone to obtain an exact solution, especially in cases of highly-absorbing and weakly-scattering media. In the most of publication it is assumed that the light must be diffuse on a surface as well as within the medium for a correct application of the KM equations. However, in our opinion, there is no any reason to separate light radiation on diffuse and collimated components in a simple 1D theoretical model. So, the root of the problem of the model accuracy may be located in a far another field.

Supercritical carbon dioxide treatment of LS samples introduced both surface and bulk microporosity for enhanced primary cell attachment and to remove toxic additives improving biocompatibility of the materials. The results of in vitro tests comprising human osteoblast cells attachment, spreading and proliferation on the implants demonstrate low level of their cytotoxicity and high level of biocompatibility. We also present a novel Surface Selective Laser Sintering (SSLS) technique for biodegradable polymer scaffolds fabrication from thermosensitive poly(D,L-lactic) - and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic) acids - polymers, which have a wide spread occurrence in biomedical applications. Unlike conventional Selective Laser Sintering (where the powder particles melt because of their volumetric absorption of the laser radiation), in SSLS initiation of the sintering occur due to near IR laser beam absorption by a small amount (<0.1wt.%) of biocompatible carbon black microparticles uniformly distributed along the polymer powder surface. This technique enable to prevent any significant changes in polymer initial structures and even incorporate bioactive enzymes into the samples. The results of our in vitro studies using 3T3 fibroblast, C2C12 myoblast and ovine meniscal chondrocyte cells cultures hold great promise for use of produced scaffolds and developed technique in tissue engineering.","Biodegradable polymer scaffolds; Laser stereolithography; Selective laser sintering; Tissue engineering","Biocompatibility; Biodegradable polymers; Cells; Hydroxyapatite; Lithography; Rapid prototyping; Scaffolds; Biodegradable polymer scaffolds; Laser stereolithography; Selective laser sintering; Tissue engineering",,,0277786X,0819467448; 9780819467447,PSISD,,"English",2-s2.0-35148867096

To this end, we developed a bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) system to deliver catalase to PD-affected brain regions in an animal model of human disease. To preclude BMM-mediated enzyme degradation, catalase was packaged into a block ionomer complex with a cationic block copolymer, polyethyleneimine-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEI-PEG). The self-assembled catalase/PEI-PEG complexes, ""nanozymes"" , were ca. 60 to 100 nm in size, stable in pH and ionic strength, and retained antioxidant activities. Cytotoxicity was negligible over a range of physiologic nanozyme concentrations. Nanozyme particles were rapidly, 40-60 min, taken up by BMM, retained catalytic activity, and released in active form for greater than 24 h. In contrast, ""naked"" catalase was rapidly degraded. The released enzyme decomposed microglial hydrogen peroxide following nitrated alpha-synuclein or tumor necrosis factor alpha activation. Following adoptive transfer of nanozyme-loaded BMM to 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- intoxicated mice, ca. 0.6% of the injected dose were found in brain.

A number of different therapeutic approaches have been developed and proposed, but so far none have proven to be fully satisfactory. We used a new tissue engineering approach to treat four patients with large bone diaphysis defects and poor therapeutic alternatives. To obtain implantable three-dimensional (3D) living constructs, cells isolated from the patients' bone marrow stroma were expanded in culture and seeded onto porous hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic scaffolds designed to match the bone deficit in terms of size and shape. During the surgical session, an Ilizarov apparatus or a monoaxial external fixator was positioned on the patient's affected limb and the ceramic cylinder seeded with cells was placed in the bone defect. Patients were evaluated at different postsurgery time intervals by conventional radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. In one patient, an angiographic evaluation was performed at 6.5 years follow-up. In this study we analyze the long-term outcome of these patients following therapy. No major complications occurred in the early or late postoperative periods, nor were major complaints reported by the patients. No signs of pain, swelling, or infection were observed at the implantation site. Complete fusion between the implant and the host bone occurred 5 to 7 months after surgery. In all patients at the last follow-up (6 to 7 years postsurgery in patients 1 to 3), a good integration of the implants was maintained. No late fractures in the implant zone were observed. The present study shows the long-term durability of bone regeneration achieved by a bone engineering approach. We consider the obtained results very promising and propose the use of culture-expanded osteoprogenitor cells in conjunction with porous bioceramics as a real and significant improvement in the repair of critical-sized long bone defects. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Bioceramics; Bone; Hydroxyapatite; Patient treatment; Porous materials; Tissue culture; Bone engineering; Bone repair; Diaphysis; Follow-up; Orthopedics; bioceramics; hydroxyapatite; adolescent; adult; article; bone defect; bone marrow; bone radiography; bone regeneration; bone remodeling; case report; cell culture; composite material; computer assisted tomography; diaphysis; female; human; long bone; male; osteolysis; priority journal; stem cell; swelling; tissue engineering; Adolescent; Adult; Bioprosthesis; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Resorption; Bone Substitutes; Ceramics; Durapatite; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Porosity; Stem Cells; Stromal Cells; Treatment Outcome",,,10763279,,TIENF,17484701,"English",2-s2.0-34249889868

Recent investigations revealed a lot of questions concerning MSC biology that should be further refined. The aim of this study was the comparative analysis of rat bone marrow stroma cells cultures. Mesenchymal precursor cells isolated from rat bone marrow were passed up to 50 times. Comparative morphological and immunophenotypical analysis of these cultures was carried out as well as their ability to osteogenic differentiation was studied. The isolated cultures contained morphologically different types of cells and thus showed a high heterogenity level. Morphology of these cell types was described.

Two materials with different PEO/PAA ratios were compared with a weakly cross-linked PAA homopolymer network. The networks bound a cationic protein, cytochrome C, due to the polyion coupling, leading to the network contraction. After binding the protein the block polyelectrolyte networks were more porous compared to a homopolymer network, facilitating protein absorption within the gel. The protein was released by adding Ca2+ ions or a polycation. Ca2+ ions migrated within the gels and reacted with PAA chains, thus displacing the protein. The polycation transfer into hydrogels, as a result of polyion substitution reactions, was inhibited by the excess of PEO chains in the block polyelectrolyte networks. Overall, these findings advance development of functional polyelectrolyte networks for immobilization and controlled release of proteins. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Block copolymers; Copolymerization; Homopolymerization; Polyethylene oxides; Proteins; Block polyelectrolyte networks; Cationic protein; Polyacrylic acid; Polycation; Polyelectrolytes; acrylic acid; calcium ion; cytochrome c; macrogol; polyacrylic acid; article; controlled drug release; controlled study; drug absorption; drug release; hydrogel; polymerization; priority journal; protein binding; substitution reaction; synthesis; Acrylic Resins; Calcium; Cytochromes c; Drug Carriers; Electrolytes; Hydrogels; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymers; Proteins; Tissue Engineering",,,15257797,,BOMAF,17291073,"English",2-s2.0-33847314696

For subsequent studies on the molecular mechanisms of postconditioning, we aimed to identify a robust postconditioning protocol in rat and mouse heart. Design. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to different postconditioning protocols (study 1 and 2). The protection was compared to preconditioning. Rats (study 3) in vivo in two different laboratories were postconditioned. Isolated mouse hearts (study 4) and mice in vivo (study 5) were postconditioned. Results. Postconditioning did not protect isolated, perfused rat hearts, however, preconditioning improved function and reduced infarct size. Postconditioning tended to protect rat hearts in vivo in one laboratory (p=0.10), whereas protection was seen in the other laboratory (infarct size 51±11% vs controls 62±3%, p=0.01). Postconditioned mouse hearts were protected, both ex vivo (16±9% vs controls 33±18%, p=0.02) and in vivo (21±5% vs 42±7%, p<0.001). Conclusions. Rat hearts are less suitable for studies of mechanisms of postconditioning. The results suggest that the signaling pathways differ between pre- and postconditioning.

Despite the large number of performed experiments in different laboratories, information on the kinetics of bone growth into the scaffolds is still scarce. Highly porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds were investigated before the implantation and after they were seeded with in vitro expanded bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and implanted for 8, 16, or 24 weeks in immunodeficient mice. Synchrotron x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) was used for qualitative and quantitative 3D characterization of the scaffold material and 3D evaluation of tissue engineered bone growth kinetics after in vivo implantation. Experiments were performed taking advantage of a dedicated set up at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France), which allowed quantitative imaging at a spatial resolution of about 5 μm. A peculiarity of these experiments was the fact that at first the data were obtained on the different pure scaffolds, then the same scaffolds were seeded by BMSC, implanted, and brought again to ESRF for investigating the formation of new bone. The volume fraction, average thickness, and distribution of the newly formed bone were evaluated as a function of the implantation time. New bone thickness increased from week 8 to week 16, but deposition of new bone was arrested from week 16 to week 24.

The first part of this work describes the measurement of the lens shape, density, sound speed and attenuation. The measured values were within the range of previously published values. In the second part, HIFU-induced lesion development was observed in real-time and compared with good agreement with theoretical simulation. Theoretical modeling included acoustic propagation, absorptive heating and thermal dose, as well as the experimentally measured lens characteristics. Thus, the transparent eye lens can be used as a laboratory phantom to facilitate the understanding of HIFU treatment in other tissues.

A dose dependent relationship was observed between Cu concentration and frequency of chromosomal aberrations. A significantly higher frequency of functional alterations, specifically decondensed centromeres and telomeres, and reduction in activity of Balbiani rings, was observed in treated material compared to control. A comparison of breakpoints resulting from treatment with chromium and lead from earlier studies with those Cu-induced identified a series of chromosomal weak points particularly vulnerable to trace metals.

Unlike stem cells, myoblasts are differentiated, immature cells destined to become muscles. Myoblasts cultured from satellite cells of adult muscle biopsies survive, develop, and function to revitalize degenerative muscles upon transplantation. Injection injury activates regeneration of host myofibers that fuse with the engrafted myoblasts, sharing their nuclei in a common gene pool of the syncytium. Thus, through nuclear transfer and complementation, the normal human genome can be transferred into muscles of patients with genetic disorders to achieve phenotype repair or disease prevention. Myoblasts are safe and efficient gene transfer vehicles endogenous to muscles that constitute 50% of body weight. Results of over 280 HMGT procedures on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) subjects in the past 15 years demonstrated absolute safety. Myoblast-injected DMD muscles showed improved histology. Strength increase at 18 months post-operatively averaged 123%. In another application of HMGT on ischemic cardiomyopathy, the first human myoblast transfer into porcine myocardium revealed that it was safe and effective. Clinical trials on approximately 220 severe cardiomyopathy patients in 15 countries showed a <10% mortality. Most subjects received autologous cells implanted on the epicardial surface during coronory artery bypass graft, or injected on the endomyocardial surface percutaneously through guiding catheters. Significant increases in left ventricular ejection fraction, wall thickness, and wall motion have been reported, with reduction in perfusion defective areas, angina, and shortness of breath. As a new modality of treatment for disease in the skeletal muscle or myocardium, HMGT emerged as safe and effective. Large randomized multi-center trials are under way to confirm these preliminary results. The future of HMGT is bright and exciting.","Heart regeneration; Human genome therapy; Myoblasts","allotransplantation; angina pectoris; angiogenesis; body weight; cardiomyopathy; catheter; cell based gene therapy; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell fusion; cell maturation; cell nucleus transplantation; cell proliferation; clinical trial; conference paper; coronary artery bypass graft; disease severity; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; dyspnea; gene transfer; genetic disorder; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; histopathology; human; ischemic heart disease; muscle atrophy; muscle biopsy; myoblast; myotube; nonhuman; phenotype; postoperative period; satellite cell; stem cell; surgical mortality; tissue engineering",,,16715411,,,,"English",2-s2.0-33845292562

The aim of the current study was to investigate if laser irradiation can enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induced angiogenesis in vitro. The study was conducted on rat thoracic aortal rings. Samples of group 1 served as control, samples of groups 2 and 3 were incubated with VEGF or FGF, group 4 samples were irradiated with laser (660 nm, 20 mW) during 10 min, samples of groups 5 and 6 were incubated with VEGF or FGF accordingly and received 10 min of laser irradiation. In the control group no noticeable angiogenesis occurred. The application of VEGF activated angiogenesis: the area covered by new vessels was 1,3±0,24 mm and the maximal length of vessels was 0,93±0,11 mm. Laser light irradiation (group 4) activated angiogenesis (1,9±0,29 mm2 and 0,75±0,10 mm). The combined influence of laser light and VEGF on angiogenesis (group 5) was significantly stronger (p &lt;0,001), than each of the factors separately (6,98±0,88 mm2 and 1,7±0,23mm). Application of FGF also activated angiogenesis: the area covered by new vessels was 2,76±0,22 mm2 and the maximal length of vessels was 1,19±0,12 mm. Combined influence of laser light and FGF on angiogenesis (group 6) was again significantly stronger (p &lt;0,001), than each of the factors separately (5,43±0,28 mm2 and 1,99±0,10 mm).

Different types of tomography allow fluorescence imaging of tumors located deep in human or animal tissue. These techniques were used for investigation of the distribution of near-infrared fluorescent probes, but only a few works are devoted to fluorescence tomography in visible light. In this work, preliminary results of the frequency domain fluorescent diffuse tomography (FD FDT) method in application to DsRed2 protein as a fluorescent agent are presented. For the first step of our experiments we utilized second harmonic generation of Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) modulated by low frequency (1 kHz) in the experimental setup. The transilluminative planar configuration was used in the setup. A series of model experiments has been conducted and show good agreement between theoretical and experimental fluorescence intensity. Post mortem experiments with capsules containing DsRed2 and scattering solution introduced into esophagus of rats to simulate tumor formation have been conducted. The results of these experiments show that sensitivity of the setup is sufficient to detect DsRed2 in concentrations similar to those in FP-expressed tumor, but the contrast is not enough high to separate fluorescence of DsRed2 and surrounding tissues. The setup can be significantly improved by utilizing high-frequency modulation (110 MHz using acousto-optical modulator) of the excitation light and precise phase measurements due to difference in fluorescence life-time of FPs and surrounding tissues. An algorithm of processing a fluorescent image based on calculating zero of maximum curvature was employed for detection of fluorescent inclusions boundaries in the image.","Fluorescent proteins; Frequency-domain fluorescent diffuse tomography; Whole-body imaging","Algorithms; Laser applications; Proteins; Scattering; Second harmonic generation; Tissue; Tomography; Tumors; Fluorescent proteins; Frequency-domain fluorescent diffuse tomography (FD FDT); Near-infrared fluorescent probes; Whole-body imaging; Biomedical engineering",,,16057422,0819461407; 9780819461407,,,"English",2-s2.0-33745189422

This study presents a characterisation of the ultrastructure of the deep-sea Bamboo coral (Anthozoa: Gorgonacea: Isididae) and the nanostructure of some interstitial surfaces with respect to biomineralization phenomena. The skeletons of the corals examined exhibit jointed axes of large bony calcareous structures alternated with smaller proteinaceous nodes of gorgonin, giving the skeletal remains of the organism a digitated appearance, like terrestrial bamboo. To test the hypothesis that bamboo coral internodes exhibit bone-like mechanical and biochemical properties, structural and biochemical analyses of these natural biomineral composites and separation of proteinaceous components was performed. Due to its high potential for colonization with both human osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the organic matrix, composed of an acidic fibrillar protein framework, proved to be a very successful model for possible applications in tissue engineering. The material properties of the calcareous internodes correlate well with the material property charts for materials used in orthopedic surgery, though denser and stronger than bone. Results of the present study also clearly indicate the quinonproteinaceous nature of the gorgonin. On the basis of the high biomimetic potential of the results obtained, the use of Isididae corals as ""living bone implants"" as well as their biotechnological aquacultural cultivation seems to be promising for the near future. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In contrast to the conventional selective laser sintering, the SSLS method makes it possible to sinter polymer microparticles and melt the near-surface layer rather than the microparticle as a whole. The effect of the laser radiation parameters and the structure and composition of the raw products on the structure and properties of the biomaterials sintered by the laser radiation is analyzed. This approach makes possible both the application of thermally unstable polymers (e.g., polylactides or polylactoglycolides) and the fabrication of scaffolds with incorporated bioactive proteins. The results obtained yield a regular physical basis for a new technology of the fabrication of various polymer scaffolds that represent important materials and elements of modern tissue engineering.

Electron microscopy, X-ray structure analysis and differential thermal analysis have been used to investigate the structure and physicochemical properties of the composite, depending on the PHB/HA ratio. The properties of the surface of the HA-loaded composite are significantly different from those of the pure polymer. As the HA percentage in the composite increases, free interface energy, the cohesive force, i.e., the strength of the adhesive bond between the composite surface and the water phase, and surface wettability increase. The HA percentage of the composite does not influence its melting temperature, but affects the temperature for the onset of decomposition: as the HA content increases from 0 to 10% (w/w), Td decreases from 260°C to 225°C. The degree of crystallinity of PHB/HA increases from 77% to 89% with an increase in the HA fraction from 10% to 50%. Functional properties of the composites have been investigated in vitro and in vivo. The best parameters of growth and differentiation of murine marrow osteoblasts are registered on PHB/HA samples containing 10% and 20% HA.

The first group, characterized by clear correlation of methylation with the transcription level, includes housekeeping gene COX6B (the absence of methylation unambiguously correlates with expression) and urothelium-specific uroplakin gene (the methylation coincides with absence of expression). The second group includes genes that are expressed in many, but not all tissues and cells. For these genes (LEAP-1 and ATP4A), there was no correlation between methylation and expression. It is possible that methylation provides some basal level of gene repression, which is overcome by binding of tissue-specific transcription factors, whereas lack of methylation gives the opportunity for gene expression in various cells and tissues. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.","Cytosine methylation; Gene regulation; Human genome","Cells; Genes; Genetic engineering; Tissue; Cytosine methylation; Gene regulation; Human genome; Nucleic acids; adenosine triphosphatase; antimicrobial cationic peptide; COX6B protein, human; cytochrome c oxidase; cytosine; FXYD5 protein, human; hepcidin; membrane protein; protein subunit; RNA; tumor protein; UPK1A protein, human; article; cell line; chemistry; chromosome 19; CpG island; gene expression; genetics; human; metabolism; methylation; promoter region; tissue distribution; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Cell Line; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19; CpG Islands; Cytosine; Electron Transport Complex IV; Gene Expression; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Methylation; Neoplasm Proteins; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Subunits; RNA; Tissue Distribution",,,00062979,,BIORA,16545066,"English",2-s2.0-33645316059

They mainly consist of the amyloid peptide Aβ and display an abnormal content in Zn2+ ions, together with many truncated, isomerized, and racemized forms of Aβ. The region 1-16 of Aβ can be considered the minimal zinc-binding domain and contains two aspartates subject to protein aging. The influence of zinc binding and protein aging related modifications on the conformation of this region of Aβ is of importance given the potentiality of this domain to constitute a therapeutic target, especially for immunization approaches. In this study, we determined from NMR data the solution structure of the Aβ-(1-16)-Zn 2+ complex in aqueous solution at pH 6.5. The residues His 6, His13, and His14 and the Glu11 carboxylate were identified as ligands that tetrahedrally coordinate the Zn(II) cation. In vitro aging experiments on Aβ-(1-16) led to the formation of truncated and isomerized species. The major isomer generated, Aβ-(1-16)-L-iso-Asp7, displayed a local conformational change in the His6-Ser8 region but kept a zinc binding propensity via a coordination mode involving L-iso-Asp7.

Methods: From July 1999 to January 2004, 204 men of mean age 26.77 (range 19-54 years) underwent this procedure. Indications for penile girth enhancement were penile dysmorphic disorder and previous failed surgery for penile girth enhancement. Fibroblast cells harvested from 1 cc of biopsied scrotal dermal tissue were expanded in culture until the total cell number of at least 2 × 107 was reached. Suspended cells in culture medium were then seeded on pretreated tube-shaped PLGA scaffolds and incubated for 24 hours. After penile degloving, scaffolds were shape adjusted and transplanted between dartos and Buck's fascia when the skin was compliant or under the neurovascular bundle when the skin was not compliant. Results: A total of 84 randomly selected patients were followed 1 to 5 years postoperatively (median 24 months). The gain in girth ranged from 1.9 to 4.1 cm (mean 3.15 cm). Postoperative complications occurred as infection in three, penile skin pressure necrosis in two and seroma formation in five patients and were all treated conservatively. Surgical intervention was appraised by patients on a scale from 1 to 5 as follows: the best mark (5) was given by 44.05%, very good (4) by 36.90%, good (3) by 19.05% and only one patient gave the mark 2 judging general penile appearance as dissatisfactory; mean score was 4.25. Conclusion: Autologous tissue engineering by using biodegradable scaffolds as a carrier is a new and safe therapeutic approach for penile girth enhancement.

Cryogels were produced through freeze-thawing techniques, either from agarose alone or from agarose with grafted gelatin. The aim of this study was to evaluate agarose cryogel sponges as scaffolds for culturing both isolated pancreatic islets and insulinoma cells (INS-1E). In order to evaluate the effect of cell entrapment in artificial scaffolds, cell function reflected by insulin secretion and content was studied in cells cultivated for a 2-week period either in culture plastic plates or in cryogel sponge disks. Our results show that tumor-derived INS-1E cells grown either on plastic or on cryogels do not differ in their proliferation, morphology, insulin release, and intracellular insulin content. However, isolated pancreatic islets cultivated on cryogels sponge show 15-fold higher basal insulin secretion at 3.0 mM glucose than islets cultivated on plastic plates and fail to respond to stimulation with 16.7 mM glucose.

It is possible that the cell dysfunction noted in these in vitro experiments is due to the effect of the limited oxygen supply to the islets cultivated in cryogel sponge.

Traditional bone-repair treatments can be divided into two groups: the bone transport (Ilizarov technology) and the graft transplant (autologous or allogeneic bone grafts). Thus far, none of these strategies have proven to be always resolving. As an alternative, a tissue engineering approach has been proposed where osteogenic cells, bioceramic scaffolds, growth factors and physical forces concur to the bone defect repair. Different sources of osteoprogenitor cells have been suggested, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) being in most cases the first choice. Methods and Results : In association with mineral tridimensional scaffolds, BMSC form a primary bone tissue which is highly vascularized and colonized by host hemopoietic marrow. The chemical composition of the scaffold is crucial for the osteoconductive properties and the resorbability of the material. In addition, scaffolds should have an internal structure permissive for vascular invasion. Porous bioceramics [hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate] are osteoconductive and are particularly advantageous for bone tissue engineering application as they induce neither an immune nor an inflammatory response in the implanted host. Earlier, we first reported a cell-based tissue engineering procedure to treat three patients with long bone segmental defects. Cells were loaded on a 100% HA porous ceramic. These scaffolds proved to have good osteoconductive properties resulting in a good functional recovery, but they have not been resorbed after more than 5 years from the implant. In addition, due to the high density of the mineral and the relatively low porosity (50-60%), it was very difficult to monitor the patient recovery during the post-surgery time using X-rays. Conclusions : We report here some pre-clinical testing of new scaffolds. To compare these second generation ceramic scaffolds more suitable for a tissue engineering approach we had to first establish animal models and analysis procedures including the use of X-ray-computed microtomography associated with X-rays synchroton radiation. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.","Animal model; Bioceramic scaffolds; Bonemarrow stromal cells; Engineered bone tissue; X-ray-computed microtomography","biomimetic material; calcium phosphate; hydroxyapatite; animal; animal model; article; bone marrow transplantation; bone regeneration; cell culture; ceramics; computer assisted tomography; female; human; methodology; mouse; nude mouse; porosity; sheep; tissue engineering; Animals; Biomimetic Materials; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Bone Regeneration; Calcium Phosphates; Cells, Cultured; Ceramics; Durapatite; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; Models, Animal; Porosity; Sheep; Tissue Engineering; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,16016335,,,16238608,"English",2-s2.0-33644664674

This study demonstrates that nuclear background may influence the formation of stable dominant nuclear gene of male sterility (MS) on the basis of unstable mutation, which was induced in tissue culture of the sorghum haploid (cv. Milo-145). The mutants with complete or partial MS segregated in variable ratios in the progenies of diploid regenerants were obtained from different experiments on cultivation of haploid tissues. In the Milo-145 genetic background the mutation demonstrated somatic instability and was gradually eliminated by self-pollination of partially sterile plants. Hybridization of the MS-plants with the sorghum line SK-723, a fertility-restorer of the cytoplasmic MS A1 (milo) type, maintained the induced mutation. By repeated backcrossing of MS-plants with SK-723, the male-sterile versions of this line (SK-723- Ms tc ) have been created. In BC-generations, fertile, partially and completely sterile plants were observed. The MS-plants from BC-generations are proposed to contain a dominant gene Ms tc while fertile plants were ms tc / ms tc homozygotes. Crossing the original MS-plants with SK-723 was a key factor in stabilization of the Ms tc gene. Dominant expression of the Ms tc was observed in male-sterile versions of other sorghum lines created by backcrossing to SK-723- Ms tc . The lines fertility-restorers for this mutation have been revealed. In the crosses of restored F1 hybrids with emasculated plants of the non-restoring line, the Ms tc has been transferred through the pollen and manifested in the F1 generation. The possibility of the Ms tc originating as a result of interaction of an unstable allele of the Milo-145 with the SK-723 genome is discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Genetic instability; Male sterility; Nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions; Somaclonal variation; Sorghum","Cultivation; Genes; Genetic engineering; Plants (botany); Tissue culture; Genetic instability; Male sterility; Nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions; Somaclonal variation; Sorgham; Mutagenesis; article; breeding; cell nucleus; comparative study; cross breeding; fertility; genetics; genome; inheritance; methodology; mutation; sorghum; Breeding; Cell Nucleus; Crosses, Genetic; Fertility; Genome, Plant; Inheritance Patterns; Mutation; Sorghum; Cultivation; Genes; Genetic Engineering; Mutagens; Plants; Tissue Culture",,,00405752,,THAGA,16205908,"English",2-s2.0-27744602431

Our recent studies have shown that His156 contributes to the 14-fold higher affinity that 3β-HSD1 exhibits for substrate and inhibitor steroids compared -with human 3β-HSD2 containing Tyr156 in the otherwise identical catalytic domain. Our structural model of human 3β-HSD localizes His156 or Tyr 156 in the subunit interface of the enzyme homodimer. The model predicts that Gln105 on one enzyme subunit has a higher probability of interacting with His156 on the other subunit in 3β-HSD1 than with Tyr156 in 3β-HSD2. The Q105M mutant of 3β-HSD1 (Q105M1) shifts the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for 3β-HSD substrate and inhibition constants (Ki) for epostane and trilostane to the much lower affinity profiles measured for wild-type 3β-HSD2 and H156Y1. However, the Q105M2 mutant retains substrate and inhibitor kinetic profiles similar to those of 3β-HSD2. Our model also predicts that Gln 240 in 3β-HSD1 and Arg240 in 3β-HSD2 may be responsible for the 3-fold higher affinity of the type 1 isomerase activity for substrate steroid and cofactors. The Q240R1 mutation increases the isomerase substrate Km by 2.2-fold to a value similar to that of 3β-HSD2 isomerase and abolishes the allosteric activation of isomerase by NADH. The R240Q2 mutation converts the isomerase substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor kinetic profiles to the 4-14-fold higher affinity profiles of 3β-HSD1. Thus, key structural reasons for the substantially higher affinities of 3β-HSD1 for substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors have been identified. These structure and function relationships can be used in future docking studies to design better inhibitors of the 3β-HSD1 that may be useful in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers and preterm labor. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Dimers; Disease control; Enzyme inhibition; Enzyme kinetics; Genetic engineering; Human engineering; Reaction kinetics; Substrates; Enzyme subunit; Homodimer; Isoforms; Kinetic profiles; Amino acids; 3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; 3beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; arginine; dimer; epostane; gene product; glutamine; histidine; isoenzyme; isomerase; mutant protein; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; steroid; trilostane; tyrosine; unclassified drug; allosterism; amino acid analysis; article; binding affinity; cancer hormone therapy; coenzyme; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme localization; enzyme substrate complex; enzyme subunit; molecular interaction; molecular model; mutation; premature labor; priority journal; protein expression; tissue specificity; wild type; 3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Allosteric Site; Amino Acid Sequence; Androstenols; Animals; Arginine; Baculoviridae; Blotting, Western; Catalysis; Catalytic Domain; Cell Line; Dihydrotestosterone; DNA Primers; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Glutamine; Histidine; Humans; Insects; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; NAD; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Structure-Activity Relationship; Substrate Specificity; Tissue Distribution",,,00219258,,JBCHA,15797861,"English",2-s2.0-20444366185

Here, we provide the first physical evidence that the onset of breast cancer cell motility in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) correlates with lowering of adhesion strength from 2.52 ± 0.20 to 1.52 ± 0.13 μdynes/μm 2 in cells attached to fibronectin via α5β 1 integrin. The adhesion strength depends on the dose of IGF-I and time of IGF-I treatment. Weakening of cell-matrix adhesion is blocked significantly (p &lt; 0.01) by the catalytically inactive IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) inhibitor LY-294002, but it is unaffected by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor UO-126 and Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Sustained blockade of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) with Y-27632 down-regulates adhesion strength in stationary, but not in IGF-I-treated, cells. Jasplakinolide, a drug that prevents actin filament disassembly, counteracts the effect of IGF-I on integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In the absence of growth factor signaling, ROCK supports a strong adhesion via α5β1 integrin, whereas activation of the IGF-IR kinase reduces cell-matrix adhesion through a PI-3K-dependent, but ROCK-independent, mechanism. We propose that disassembly of the actin filaments via PI-3 kinase pathway contributes to weakening of adhesion strength and induction of cell movement.

This process allows preventing significant overheating of the particles internal domains which can lead to polymer properties changes and degradation.

PLA and PLGA samples homogeneously filled with 30wt.% of synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) were produced by mould casting, scCO2 processing and one-stage direct synthesis in scCO2. All samples were analysed by optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy and Gel Permeation Chromatography to study their surface and internal domain morphology, molecular weight Mw and polydispersity Mn. The samples were also implanted into white rat femoral bone epiphysis to study living tissue response. It was shown that one-step direct synthesis in scCO2 is the most preferable method of porous composite scaffold fabrication in terms of preventing any changes in Mw and Mn, as well as, the best results on osteointegration and new bone formation. © 2004 Materials Research Society.",,"Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Casting; Morphology; Polymers; Porosity; Scaffolds; Tissue; Hydroxyapatite (HA); Polymeric scaffolds; Scaffold fabrication; Tissue engineering; Biomaterials",,,02729172,,MRSPD,,"English",2-s2.0-23844485515

A common problem for healthy volunteers examined during isolation, and for the patients suffering from heart failure is a quantitative estimation tissue oedema. Until now, objective assessment body fluids retention in tissues did not exist. Optical imaging of living capillaries is a challenging and medically important scientific problem. Goal of the investigation was to study dynamic of microcirculation parameters including tissue oedema in healthy volunteers during extended isolation and relative hypokinesia as a model of mission to the International Space Station. The other aim was to study dynamic of microcirculation parameters including tissue oedema in patients suffering from heart failure under treatment. Healthy volunteers and patients. We studied four healthy male subjects at the age of 41, 37, 40, and 48 before the experiment (June 1999), and during the 240-d isolation period starting from July 3, 1999. Unique hermetic chambers with artificial environmental parameters allowed performing this study with maximum similarity to real conditions in the International Space Station (ISS). With the regularity of 3 times a week at the same time, each subject recorded three video episodes with the total length of one-minute using the optical computerized capillaroscope for noninvasive measurement of the capillary diameters sizes, capillary blood velocity as well as the size of the perivascular zone.

They are extremely useful in heart attack therapy. Modern and most appropriate way of scaled up production of these valuable proteins is gene engineering. In this case, a separation and a purification of target product become the important steps of the whole process. Recently developed affinity chromatography on short monolithic columns seems to be a very attractive method for these purposes. High speed of a process prevents the protein's denaturation due to temperature or/and solvents influence. The better mass transfer mechanism (convection rather than diffusion) allows considering only biospecific complexing as time limiting step. Specificity of several synthetic peptides to plasminogen activators have been studied by affinity chromatography on short monolithic columns. Peptide ligands were synthesized by conventional solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The immobilization procedure was carried out as a one step process at static conditions. The results of quantitative evaluation of such affinity interactions were compared with those established for plasminogen that is the natural affinity counterpart to both proteases. Additionally, some of investigated peptides were synthesized directly on GMA-EDMA disks and their affinity properties were compared with those established for the case of immobilized ligands. The possibility of using of synthetic peptidyl ligands for plasminogen activators isolation from native cell supernatant and model protein mixtures has been demonstrated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Total 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs) were in the range of 210-920 pgTEQ/g fat wt (180-800 pgTEQ/g wet wt) in the blubber and 290-7800 pgTEQ/g fat wt(10-570 pgTEQ/wet wt) in the liver.

Recent studies indicate that the innate component of immune defense plays an important role in the establishment of antigen-specific immune response. We have previously isolated a novel mouse gene tag7/PGRP that was shown to be involved in the innate component of the immune system, and its insect homologue is an upstream mediator of Toll signaling in Drosophila. Methods. Transiently or stably genetically modified mouse tumor cell lines expressing Tag7 were used. Tumor growth rate and animal survival were analyzed. Possible effector cells involved in tumor suppression were detected immunohistochemically. Results. Transfection of mammary gland adenocarcinoma cells with the tag7 cDNA did not alter their growth rate in vitro but diminished their tumorogenicity in vivo in syngeneic and immunodeficient animals. Increased incidence of apoptosis was registered in the modified tumors. Transient expression of Tag7 by mouse melanoma M3 cells elicited protective immunity against parental tumor cells. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumors after immunization with the genetically modified cells were infiltrated with Mac1+ cells, B220+ cells, and NK cells. Using nude mice we observed rejection of modified cells, but did not detect memory formation. Conclusions. We can conclude that secretion of the Tag7 protein by genetically modified cells can induce mobilization of antigen-presenting cells and innate effectors. Memory mechanisms are mediated by T cell response. For the first time our results demonstrate that local secretion of Tag7 - the molecule involved in innate immunity - may play an important role in the induction of effective antitumor response in mice.

The consistency of the results obtained with SHIELD-HIT has been verified against experimental data and other existing Monte Carlo codes (PTRAN, PETRA), as well as with deterministic models for ion transport, comparing depth distributions of energy deposition by protons, 12C and 20Ne ions impinging on water. The SHIELD-HIT code yields distributions consistent with a proper treatment of nuclear inelastic collisions. Energy depositions up to and well beyond the Bragg peak due to nuclear fragmentations are well predicted. Satisfactory agreement is also found with experimental determinations of the number of fragments of a given type, as a function of depth in water, produced by 12C and 14N ions of 670 MeV u-1, although less favourable agreement is observed for heavier projectiles such as 16O ions of the same energy. The calculated neutron spectra differential in energy and angle produced in a mimic of a Martian rock by irradiation with 12C ions of 290 MeV u-1 also shows good agreement with experimental data. It is concluded that a careful analysis of stopping power data for different tissues is necessary for radiation therapy applications, since an incorrect estimation of the position of the Bragg peak might lead to a significant deviation from the prescribed dose in small target volumes. The results presented in this study indicate the usefulness of the SHIELD-HIT code for Monte Carlo simulations in the field of light ion radiation therapy. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer simulation; Heavy ions; Ion beams; Ionic conduction; Ionization; Monte Carlo methods; Protons; Tissue; Coulomb scattering; Ion beam transport; Biomedical engineering; carbon; ion; neon; nitrogen; oxygen; water; analytic method; controlled study; elasticity; energy consumption; hadron; ion transport; ionization; Monte Carlo method; prediction; priority journal; proton transport; radiation beam; radiation depth dose; radiotherapy; review; simulation; Algorithms; Biological Transport; Biophysics; Carbon; Heavy Ions; Ions; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Neutrons; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Phantoms, Imaging; Protons; Radiation; Software",,,00319155,,PHMBA,15214534,"English",2-s2.0-2942618943

For equine tendon the birefringence Δn is (6.0 ± 0.2) × 10-3 at a wavelength of 1.3 μm. This is somewhat larger than the values reported for bovine tendon. The surface region of the annulus fibrosus of a freshly excised intact bovine intervertebral disc displays an identical value of birefringence, Δn = (6.0 ± 0.6) × 10-3 at 1.3 μm. The nucleus pulposus does not display birefringence, the measured apparent value of Δn = (0.39 ± 0.01) × 10-3 being indistinguishable from the effects of depolarization due to multiple scattering. A clear difference is found between the depth-resolved retardance of equine tendon and that of bovine intervertebral disc. This apparently relates to the lamellar structure of the latter tissue, in which the collagen fibre orientation alternates between successive lamellae. A semi-empirical model based on Jones calculus shows that the measurements are in reasonable agreement with previous optical and x-ray data.

Their porous structure allows tissue infiltration to incorporate the fabric for complete healing and device stabilization. This study was aimed to reconstitute the esophageal wall and to investigate the functional and histological consequences of a new, non-absorbable polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh and an absorbable polyglactin 910 (Vicryl®) mesh. Methods: Semicircular esophageal defects of 0.5 x 1 cm were created 2 cm proximal of the cardia in 10 rabbits. This gap was bridged using either polyglactin 910 or PVDF and additionally covered by omental wrapping. The clinical outcome was observed by clinical observation, regular esophagoscopies and X-ray contrast medium examinations. Local tissue regeneration was verified by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Results: After an observation period of 3 months we found no anastomotic strictures, complete mucosal regeneration, minimal inflammation reaction and initial regeneration of the muscle layer for the PVDF group. Within the polyglactin 910 group, three patch failures with consecutive anastomotic leakage occurred. Conclusion: The results indicate that PVDF mesh structure gives the opportunity of local tissue regeneration in the esophagus. Though re-epithelialization and muscle cell ingrowth could be detected for absorbable polyglactin 910 mesh, this implant was accompanied by a high and early rate of anastomotic leakage.

Fluorescence spectroscopy is based on the detection of biochemical and optical coherence tomography on backscattering properties in norm and pathological changes of tissues. By means of these optical methods changes in biochemical and morphological properties of tissues were investigated. A parallel analysis of these two optical methods and histology from the center of tumors and their optical borders was made. Thirteen female patients with neoplastic changes in uterine cervix and vulva were enrolled in this study. The borders of the tumor determined by optical methods (fluorescence spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography) are coinciding with the biopsy proved ones. In addition, OCT and fluorescence borders of tumor in the uterine cervix and vulva exceeds colposcopically detectable borders, the averaging difference 2 mm.

One very different approach to pain management is the application of micro- to milliamp current applied to specific areas of the head. While this may sound like a novel concept to most of us, years of research indicate that transcranial electrotherapy stimulation (TES) can work to noninvasively increase release of endogenous opioids from pain management regions of the brain. Traditionally, TES devices combined direct and alternating currents to be applied to electrodes placed on the subject's head. We have developed the TESA, which is similar to a TES device except that it supplies only high frequency AC current. An early feasibility study demonstrates that this device may also be effective in treating pain without the side effects seen in TES devices.

PHB and PHB/PHV (PHBV) implants produced no adverse effect on physiological, biochemical and functional parameters of the animals during the post-surgery period. The tested PHA sutures featured the necessary strength throughout the healing period of the muscle-fascial cuts. The reaction of tissues to the implantation of PHB and PHB/PHV fibers fitted into the usual scheme characteristic of the wound process and of the reaction to a foreign-body invasion. This reaction and the reaction of tissues to silk had the similar nature and period of inflammation, but it was much less pronounced than the reaction to catgut. The tissue response to the implantation of PHAs consisted in a short-duration (up to 2 weeks) post-traumatic inflammation and the formation of a fibrous capsule less than 200 μm thick during weeks 4-8, which in 4-6 months was reduced to 40-60 μm in the course of reverse development. There were no adverse changes, such as suppurative inflammation, necrosis, calcification, and malignization of the cicatrice, at the site of implantation of PHA filaments, unlike in the cases with silk and catgut. In the case of PHA implantation there was a typical prolonged (throughout the post-surgery monitoring period) pronounced macrophagal stage with a large number of macrophages present. The macrophages were of the phagocytic type and multinucleate giant foreign cells, with a high activity of acid phosphomonoesterase that correlated with the activity of the enzyme in blood. Throughout the period of monitoring no differences in the tissue response to the implantation of the polymer filaments of two PHA types were recorded. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Liver regeneration studies with genetically altered mice that either prematurely expressed FoxM1B in hepatocytes or contained a hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Foxm1b allele demonstrated that FoxM1B is critical for regulating the expression of cell cycle genes required for hepatocyte proliferation. Furthermore, preventing the decline in hepatocyte FoxM1B levels during aging was sufficient to increase regenerating hepatocyte proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes to levels found in young regenerating mouse liver. Although these liver regeneration studies demonstrated that FoxM1B is required for hepatocyte proliferation, whether FoxM1B regulates proliferation of cell types other than hepatocytes remains to be determined. Here, we developed a new TG mouse line in which the -800-base pair Rosa26 promoter was used to drive expression of the FoxM1B transgene in all mouse tissues and found that Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mice were healthy, displaying no developmental defects. We used butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) lung injury to demonstrate that premature expression of the FoxM1B transgene protein accelerated proliferation of different lung cell types, including alveolar type II epithelial cells, bronchial epithelial and smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells of pulmonary capillaries and arteries. This was associated with the earlier expression of the cell cycle promoting cyclin A2, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cyclin F, and cyclin dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1) genes and diminished protein levels of Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1.

It undergoes a Ca2+-myristoyl switch when Ca2+ binds to its two functional EF-hand motifs (EF-hands 2 and 3), each present in one of recoverin's two domains. Impairment of Ca2+-binding in recoverin leads to a disturbance of the Ca2+-myristoyl switch and loss of its regulatory properties, i.e. inhibiton of rhodopsin kinase. We have engineered recoverin mutants with either of the two functional EF-hands disabled, but with a functional Ca2+-binding site in EF-hand 4. While a defect in EF-hand 2 could not be rescued by the additional EF-hand 4, the impairment of EF-hand 3 was powerfully compensated by Ca2+-binding to EF-hand 4. For example, the myristoylated form of the latter mutant bound to membranes in a Ca2+-dependent way and was able to inhibit rhodopsin kinase in a way similar to that of the wild-type protein. Thus, for recoverin to undergo a Ca2+-myristoyl switch, it is necessary and sufficient to have either of the two EF-hands in the second domain in a functional state. On the basis of these results and inspection of published three-dimensional structures of recoverin, we propose a model highlighting the mutual interdependence of sterical configurations in EF-hands 3 and 4 of recoverin. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The study area was the coastal habitats of the northwestern Sea of Japan, which has a broad range of contamination due to urban sewage. Significant increases of all metals, except Ni, were observed in mussel Crenomytilus grayanus at concentrations of easily leachable metals in ambient sediments higher than 2, 100, and 800 μg/g for Cd, Cu, and Zn, respectively. Pb was accumulated by the mussels with no distinct threshold in Pb contamination of sediments. After 2 months, C. grayanus transplanted from a pristine to a contaminated locality increased in Pb up to 12%, and Cu up to 68% of concentrations of these metals in the contaminated local mussels, but Zn and Cd concentrations increased only in the excretory tissue, not in the somatic tissue, or in the soft tissue as a whole. Such regulation of metal accumulation puts limitations on the use of C. grayanus for monitoring of slightly and moderately contaminated localities. On the other hand, the oyster Crassostrea gigas showed definite accumulation of all metals, except Ni, at moderate contamination of ambient sediments. As contamination of sediments increased, increases of Pb, Zn and Cu concentrations in C. gigas slowed, possibly due to physiological control at very high metal concentrations in oyster soft tissue. Thus, the mussel C. grayanus should be used mainly for the monitoring of heavy contaminated localities, and the oyster C. gigas is more suitable as an indicator of low and moderate contamination. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy is used to examine infrared tissue absorption spectra before and after irradiation. Light scattering by bovine and porcine cartilage and cornea samples is measured in real time during FEL irradiation using a 650-nm diode laser and a diode photoarray with time resolution of 10 ms. The data on the time dependence of light scattering in the tissue are modeled to estimate the approximate values of kinetic parameters for denaturation as functions of laser wavelength and radiant exposure. We found that the denaturation threshold is slightly lower for cornea than for cartilage, and both depend on laser wavelength. An inverse correlation between denaturation thresholds and the absorption spectrum of the tissue is observed for many wavelengths; however, for wavelengths near 3 and 6 μm, the denaturation threshold does not exhibit the inverse correlation, instead being governed by heating kinetics of tissue. It is shown that light scattering is useful for measuring the denaturation thresholds and dynamics for different biotissues, except where the initial absorptivity is very high.","Absorption spectra; Cartilage; Cornea; Denaturation; Laser-tissue interaction; Light scattering","Absorption spectroscopy; Biopolymers; Cartilage; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Free electron lasers; Laser applications; Laser tissue interaction; Light measurement; Light scattering; Monitoring; Optics; Radiation effects; Attenuated total reflectance; Cartilage denaturation; Cornea denaturation; Free electron laser radiation; Inverse correlation; Biomedical engineering; Bovinae; Suidae; protein; absorption; article; biological model; cartilage; chemistry; comparative study; cornea; electron; evaluation; infrared spectroscopy; laser; light; metabolism; methodology; nose septum; optical tomography; physiology; protein denaturation; radiation exposure; radiation response; Absorption; Cartilage; Cornea; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Electrons; Lasers; Light; Models, Biological; Nasal Septum; Protein Denaturation; Proteins; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Tomography, Optical",,,10833668,,JBOPF,12683847,"English",2-s2.0-0037593849

Element concentrations were low in both C. cucullata and H. splendens, although concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu, Ni and Pb were significantly higher than those in Arctic Alaska, probably due to natural differences in the geochemical environments. Inorganic surface soils had significantly higher concentrations of Cd, Zn, Pb and Mg than inorganic soils at depth, although a lake sediment core from the eastern Taimyr Peninsula indicated no recent enrichment by atmospherically transported elements. Tissue concentrations of heavy metals in fish and lemming were not elevated relative to other Arctic sites.

In lower eukaryotes, co-expressed genes are often found in pairs. Clustering of genes that share aspects of transcriptional regulation has also been reported in higher eukaryotes. To advance our understanding of the mode of coordinated gene regulation in multicellular organisms, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the chromosomal distribution of co-expressed genes in Drosophila. We identified a total of 1,661 testes-specific genes, one-third of which are clustered on chromosomes. The number of clusters of three or more genes is much higher than expected by chance. We observed a similar trend for genes upregulated in the embryo and in the adult head, although the expression pattern of individual genes cannot be predicted on the basis of chromosomal position alone.

If proven in clinical trial, the technique may be useful for differentiating malignant tumors with enhanced vascularity from normal tissues and benign lesions. The technique is based on observing the dynamics of light attenuation in the breast tissue in response to an external pressure stimulus. The attenuation is related to blood flow and blood oxygenation. In the proposed technique the measurements are made in the red spectral wavelength region where hemoglobin serves as a natural contrast agent. In order to understand and interpret the temporal dynamic of attenuation or signatures, a model of blood circulation in zones of tumor and normal tissues is developed. The blood volume, blood flow, and oxygen saturation level are evaluated using a lumped fluid flow model incorporating published hemodynamics data obtained from biopsy samples or in-situ chamber growth of human tumor. The hemodynamics properties are translated into temporal optical attenuation profiles. We compare the optical signatures in areas with active tumor growth and in normal tissues. The results suggest that the differences in the transient response may be used as a secondary diagnostic tool in breast imaging or as a monitoring tool in anti-angiogenesis drug therapy.","Angiogenesis; Breast cancer; Dynamic optical image; Light attenuation; Model of blood circulation","Blood; Computer simulation; Hemoglobin; Medical imaging; Oncology; Optical properties; Tissue; Blood circulation; Breast tissue; Light attenuation; Malignant tumors; Mechanical loading; Biomedical engineering",,,0277786X,,PSISD,,"English",2-s2.0-1342310632

'Esfil' polypropylene endoprostheses are biologically inert and resist the action of tissue fluids. The hydrophoby and solidity of the threads prevent the meshes from becoming infected.

The 'Eslan' meshes are substantially softer and can be used when so-called 'gentle' implants are required. However, the capillarity of lavsan filaments may cause wound infections. The 'Ftorex' prostheses do not suffer from this disadvantage, due to impregnation of the pores between multifilaments with fluoropolymer. At the same time, the manipulation properties of the prostheses remain stable and their biocompatibility and bioresistance increase.

Typical specimens are developed for operation at frequencies of 434, 70, 40, and 27 MHz. The main common features of CFMA, namely, their flexibility and light weight, as well as their aperture dimensions slightly depend on the operating frequency. Two antenna types are used in CFMAs: inductive antennas with a radiating plane electrical dipole at microwaves, and coplanar capacitive antennas, providing depression of the normal component of the electrical field in the very high-frequency (VHF) and high-frequency (HF) range. The flexibility of the applicators enables one to conform them with curved surfaces. In a bent state of the applicators there arises a focusing effect of energy deposition in deeper located tissues due to linear polarization of the irradiated electromagnetic (EM) field, inherent in CFMA. All CFMA are integrated with silicon water boluses which serve as a matching element, so as a skin cooling agent. Due to this and to the predominance of the tangential electrical component in the radiated EM field, no fat overheating effects are noticed, as a rule. The aperture of the developed applicators overlap the range 160-630 cm2 providing effective heating field sizes (EFSs) 64-400 cm2, respectively. The most bulky CFMAs with an aperture of (21 x 29) cm2 operating at the frequency of 434 MHz weigh 0.8 kg and 2.5 kg at 27 MHz. Phenomenological analysis of the radiating systems, as well as experimental evaluation of the applicators are presented.

Theoretical researches of human tumor revealed the fact that temperature distribution of tissues around a tumor formed a Gaussian statistics.

Our results showed that the thermal properties of tumor imitator well agreed with heat-transfer properties of a real tumor and the proportional linear relationship existed between the location of tumor imitator and the intensity of radiometer measurements.

The residue pattern in both resident and migratory birds was in the following order: PCBs > DDTs > HCHs > CHLs. OC concentrations in migratory birds varied, depending on the feeding habit. The maximum levels of OCs were found in piscivores, followed by insectivores, omnivores, and herbivores. OC residue levels in Lake Baikal birds were lower than those in the Great Lakes region as well as in other lakes in Europe and Japan. Concentrations of HCHs and DDTs in most of the migratory birds collected in the spring were higher than for those collected in the autumn, indicating a notable accumulation in wintering grounds. Compilation and analysis of the available data in fish and birds from Asia suggested that the tropical and subtropical regions in south Asian countries may be a source of pollution for the wintering accumulation of migratory birds from Lake Baikal. Relatively higher compositions of α- and γ-HCH in total HCHs, p,p′-DDT in total DDTs were observed in some migratory species, indicating recent exposure to HCHs and DDTs in Lake Baikal or wintering areas. PCB isomer patterns were different between residents and migrants, with the predominance of lower chlorinated congeners in migratory species, suggesting recent PCB accumulation in stopover sites during wintering. TEQ concentrations of toxic non- and mono-ortho coplanar PCBs in common terns from Lake Baikal were comparable to those reported in some species from Japan, the United States, and Europe. Relative contributions of non-ortho coplanar congeners to toxic equivalents (TEQs) were predominant, in which CB-126 accounted for the highest toxicity contribution. Estimated TEQ concentrations in the common tern from Lake Baikal exceeded the levels associated with enzyme induction in bald eagles.

But this effect can have potentially a strong influence on a total light field into a tissue. So, the development of different theoretical methods and models to calculate a surface scattering is the important problem in biomedical optics. One of such theoretical approach can be based on the electromagnetic wave diffraction theory (ewdt) if the peculiarities of optical waveband will be taken into account. The basis exact Ewdt allows to determine the scattering field from the perfectly conducting rough surfaces in relative units or in the terms of radiophysical cross section. For light wavelengths in biomedical optics another conducting boundary conditions are needed and the result must be presented in optical terms and absolute units. The use of Ewdt in application to the biomedical optics becomes possible by means of exact comparative analysis of the essential conceptions of the photometry and diffraction theories, which has been made in this work. The physically correct approximation for biomedical optics was obtained with the Leontovich's (well-conducting) boundary conditions (lbc). Using the Ewdt and Lbc for a randomly rough surface we had studied the possibilities of description of light scattering on a real poor-conducting and rough biological tissues, especially for the transmitted through surface intensity of the light. The analytical equation for scattered and transmitted intensity in case of Lbs was obtained in our work. It is theoretically shown that the roughnesses of biological surfaces have not a strong influence on a total reflected light and have a some influence on an internal scattered light field. © 2002 SPIE ·1605-7422/02/$15.00.","Boundary conditions; Diffraction; Laser; Rough surfaces; Scattering","Biomedical engineering; Boundary conditions; Diffusion; Light propagation; Light reflection; Light scattering; Mathematical models; Photometry; Refractive index; Surface roughness; Biological surfaces; Laser tissue interaction",,,0277786X,,,,"English",2-s2.0-0036378686

The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are intracellular inclusions consisting primarily of α-synuclein. Although essentially all cases of sporadic and early-onset Parkinson's disease are of unknown etiology, two point mutations (A53T and A30P) in the α-synuclein gene have been identified in familial early-onset Parkinson's disease. Previous reports have shown that mutant α-synuclein may form fibrils more rapidly than wildtype protein. To determine the underlying molecular basis for the enhanced fibrillation of the mutants, the structural properties, responses to changes in the environment, and propensity to aggregate of wildtype, A30P, and A53T α-synucleins were systematically investigated. A variety of biophysical methods, including far-UV circular dichroism, FTIR, small-angle X-ray scattering, and light scattering, were employed. Neither the natively unfolded nor the partially folded intermediate conformations are affected by the familial Parkinson's disease point mutations. However, both mutants underwent self-association more readily than the wild type (i.e., at much lower protein concentration and more rapidly). We attribute this effect to the increased propensity of their partially folded intermediates to aggregate, rather than to any changes in the monomeric natively unfolded species. This increased propensity of these mutants to aggregate, relative to wild-type α-synuclein, would account for the correlation of these mutations with Parkinson's disease.",,"Movement disorders; Agglomeration; Human engineering; Inclusions; Light scattering; Pathology; Structure (composition); X ray scattering; Diseases; alpha synuclein; mutant protein; protein a30p; protein a53t; unclassified drug; article; cell inclusion; circular dichroism; correlation function; dopaminergic nerve cell; familial disease; gene mutation; human; infrared spectroscopy; Lewy body; light scattering; Parkinson disease; point mutation; priority journal; protein aggregation; protein conformation; protein folding; protein structure; substantia nigra; ultraviolet radiation; X ray crystallography; alpha-Synuclein; Amino Acid Substitution; Circular Dichroism; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Light; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Parkinson Disease; Phosphoproteins; Point Mutation; Protein Conformation; Protein Structure, Secondary; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Scattering, Radiation; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Synucleins; Thermodynamics; X-Rays",,,00062960,,BICHA,11560511,"English",2-s2.0-0035949542

Initial attempts used spatial derivatives of tissue velocity (Doppler) signals. Here, an alternate method is proposed based on two-dimensional phase-sensitive speckle tracking applied to very high frame rate, real-time images. This processing can produce high resolution maps of the time derivative of the strain magnitude (i.e., square root of the strain intensity). Such images complement traditional tissue velocity images (TVI), providing a more complete description of cardiac mechanics. To test the proposed approach, SRI were both simulated and measured on a thick-walled, cylindrical, tissue-equivalent phantom modeling cardiac deformations. Real-time ultrasound images were captured during periodic phantom deformation, where the period was matched to the data capture rate of a commercial scanner mimicking high frame rate imaging of the heart.

It was found that blood optical clearing is defined not only by refractive index matching effect, but also by changes of RBC size and their aggregation ability when chemicals are added. Chemical agents studied include glycerol, propylene glycol, trazograph, and dextrans. For the hyperosmotic agents, the application of 6.5% glycerol into twice diluted blood reduces the total attenuation coefficient from 4.2/mm to 2.0/mm, and correspondingly increases the optical penetration at 820 nm up to 117%. Similar effects of increase in transmittance and decrease in light scattering are also demonstrated by various molecular detrans with the light penetration enhancement within a range between 52.1% and 150.5%.

With this instrument, it may be possible to monitor cell growth and tissue development in tissue engineering. To test this hypothesis, elasticity micrographs were obtained in two model systems commonly used for tissue engineering. In the first, strain images of a tissue-engineered smooth muscle sample clearly identified a several hundred micron thick cell layer from its supporting matrix. Because a one-dimensional mechanical model was appropriate for this system, strain images alone were sufficient to image the elastic properties. In contrast, a second system was investigated in which a simple one-dimensional mechanical model was inadequate. Uncultured collagen microspheres embedded in an otherwise homogeneous gel were imaged with the elasticity microscope. Strain images alone did not clearly depict the elastic properties of the hard spherical cell carriers. However, reconstructed elasticity images could differentiate the hard inclusion from the background gel. These results strongly suggest that the elasticity microscope may be a valuable tool for tissue engineering and other applications requiring the elastic properties of soft tissue at high spatial resolution (75 μm or less).",,"Acoustic microscopes; Image reconstruction; Mathematical models; Strain; Tissue culture; Elasticity microscopes; Tissue engineering; Ultrasonic imaging",,,08853010,,ITUCE,,"English",2-s2.0-0034228115

Professor N.A. Rolpakova (TPU, Chemical Engineering Faculty) uses the technique of platinum (Pt) test in biological materials (blood, urine, tissue) of patients having Pt treatment by an IV method was developed. Pt is used for treatment of oncological diseases. Its molecules bind the cells of a cancerous growth. To know the concentration of this drug in the blood of an oncological patient is necessary for overseeing a course of treatment. The essence of the method is the following: the Pt from assay is transferred to solution. The solution is placed in glass for polarographic measurement. The electrodes are inserted: an operating electrode (impregnated graphite electrode) and a comparison electrode (AgCl). During a definite time (the time of electrolysis) the Pt concentrates on the surface of an electrode together with mercury, which is beforehand entered in a parsed solution (metal-activator). The current of oxidation of the metal-activator, deposited together with Pt, is proportional to the content of Pt in the parsed assay. The content of Pt is determined by a method of standard components. © 2000 IEEE.",,"Biological materials; Blood; Electrodes; Engineering education; Fluorescence; Graphite electrodes; Heavy metals; Inverse problems; Patient treatment; Platinum; Polarographs; Teaching; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Biological objects; Cancerous growth; Comparison electrodes; Inverse voltammetry; Oncological disease; Polarographic measurement; Standard components; X ray fluorescence analysis; Platinum metals",,,,0780357892; 9780780357891,,,"English",2-s2.0-84952910918

We recently reported that coadministration of CD86 cDNA along with DNA encoding HIV-1 Ags i.m. dramatically increased Ag-specific CTL responses. We investigated whether the bone marrow-derived professional APCs or muscle cells were responsible for the enhancement of CTL responses following CD86 coadministration. Accordingly, we analyzed CTL induction in bone marrow chimeras. These chimeras are capable of generating functional viral-specific CTLs against vaccinia virus and therefore represent a useful model system to study APC/T cell function in vivo. In vaccinated chimeras, we observed that only CD86 + Ag + MHC class I results in 1) detectable CTLs following in vitro restimulation, 2) detectable direct CTLs, 3) enhanced IFN-γ production in an Ag-specific manner, and 4) dramatic tissue invasion of T cells. These results support that CD86 plays a central role in CTL induction in vivo, enabling non-bone marrow-derived cells to prime CTLs, a property previously associated solely with bone marrow-derived APCs.",,"b7 antigen; beta 2 microglobulin; cd86 antigen; cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen 4; DNA vaccine; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; virus envelope protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen presenting cell; antigen specificity; article; bone marrow cell; cell surface; chimera; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic t lymphocyte; female; human immunodeficiency virus 1; lymphocytic infiltration; major histocompatibility complex restriction; mouse; muscle cell; nonhuman; priority journal; t lymphocyte activation; vaccination; vaccinia virus; virus infection; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD80; Antigens, CD86; beta 2-Microglobulin; Cell Movement; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Female; H-2 Antigens; HIV Envelope Protein gp160; Lymphocyte Activation; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Muscle, Skeletal; Protein Engineering; Radiation Chimera; Stem Cells; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Transfection",,,00221767,,JOIMA,10092797,"English",2-s2.0-0033559895

GH activates expression of the gene of IGF-I and stimulates its secretion by the liver, adipose tissue, thymus, and other tissues. The growth-stimulating effect of GH is mediated (at least partially) by IGF-I, but direct (IGF-I-independent) influence on target tissues is also possible.

OCT imaging allows one to clearly differentiate between caries and noncaries lesions, which is very important in practical dentistry. OCT has made it possible to quite accurately diagnose a fissure caries in the early stage that has been unreliable with an X-ray examination. The OCT technique is capable of dynamic monitoring the restorative process. It also allows in vivo examination of fillings as well as the state of surrounding tissues.

In addition, the tissue specificity of the expression of different genes of the family of Na+,K+-ATPase genes and their low expression in tumor cells have been demonstrated. © 1987.","(Na++K+)-ATPase; Gene expression; Gene family; Genomic blotting; Restriction fragment length polymorphism; Tissue specificity","complementary dna; embryo; endocrine system; female genital system; genetic engineering; human; kidney; lung; mouse; placenta; pregnancy; priority journal; rabbit; respiratory system; restriction fragment length polymorphism; thyroid gland; tumor; Animals; DNA; Fetus; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mice; Na(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase; Neoplasms; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Polymorphism, Genetic; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Rabbits; Mammalia; Oryctolagus cuniculus",,,00145793,,FEBLA,2887455,"English",2-s2.0-0023237856

During the 7-day space flights of the international visiting expeditions a significant decrease in pO2ic by 3.28 kPa was observed. Local oxygen utilization reduced significantly by 0.44 kPa. During hyperventilation testing after return to earth a statistically significant decrease in the peak value by 1.39 kPa was noted. In the long-term crews of the orbital station Salyut-6 the highest decrease in pO2ic of 3.8 kPa and the absolutely lowest value of 3.4 ± 0.5 kPa during space flight were observed. The decrease in local oxygen utilization during the flight of 0.8 kPa/min was greater than that of the visiting crews. The results indicate the importance of investigating the dynamics of the oxygen regimen for medical control of the crew members both during the space flight and during the readaptation phase after return to earth. © 1986.",,"BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING; OXYGEN TRANSPORT IN TISSUES; SPACE FLIGHT; oxygen; adaptation; adult; aerospace medicine; article; breath analysis; chemistry; Flight Experiment; human; hyperventilation; long duration; male; manned; middle aged; oxygen consumption; physiology; pressure; Salyut 6 Project; short duration; skin; Soyuz Project; space flight; weightlessness; Flight Experiment; long duration; manned; Salyut 6 Project; short duration; Soyuz Project; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Breath Tests; Humans; Hyperventilation; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Partial Pressure; Skin; Space Flight; Weightlessness",,,00945765,,AASTC,11542832,"English",2-s2.0-0022716549

It is shown that the relaxation properties are more pronounced in cold-blooded animals myocardium (frog, turtle) than in that of warm-blooded (cat, rabbit), which correlates with the smaller connective tissue content and larger porosity of myocardium in cold-blooded animals. The decrease in porosity of the cardiac muscle samples by reducing the osmosis of the surrounding solution or squeezing the fluid out of the samples by mechanical torsion results in the slowing down of the stress relaxation, the increase in porosity of the muscle in the hyperosmotic solution results in its speeding up. The increase of the surrounding solution viscosity by adding saccharose to it leads to the proportional stress relaxation deceleration, which agrees quantitatively and qualitatively with the advanced hypothesis. © 1984.",,"animal; article; cat; elastic tissue; extracellular space; frog; heart; heart contraction; heart papillary muscle; mathematics; mechanical stress; physiology; rabbit; turtle; viscosity; Animal; Cats; Elastic Tissue; Extracellular Space; Heart; Mathematics; Myocardial Contraction; Papillary Muscles; Rabbits; Ranidae; Stress, Mechanical; Turtles; Viscosity; BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING - Cytology; FILTRATION; FLOW OF FLUIDS - Porous Materials; VISCOELASTICITY - Measurements; CONNECTIVE TISSUE NETWORK; EXTRACELLULAR FLUID FILTRATION; MUSCLE STRESS RELAXATION; MYOCYTES; PASSIVE MYOCARDIUM; BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS",,,00219290,,JBMCB,6526833,"English",2-s2.0-0021645085

Thirty-five mice derived from eggs injected with SA7 DNA were screened for the presence of the adenovirus genome in their liver DNA. Eighteen of these mice contained the virus-specific sequences. SA7 DNA was detected in some tissues, but in all cases, viral sequences were absent from muscle and heart DNA. Viral DNA was inherited by 50-70% of the next generation. One mouse that contained about 1 copy of SA7 DNA per haploid genome has been shown to pass it on to five generations, although the integrated viral DNA sustained a considerable structural change between F1 and F3. RNA analysis in various organs of 12 mice has shown the transcription of SA7 DNA to be very infrequent: only in the kidney of one mouse and in the spleen of another did RNA contain SA7-specific sequences. © 1984.","DNA hybridization; gene expression; microinjection into eggs; simian adenovirus DNA","radioisotope; virus dna; adenovirus; animal experiment; dna dna hybridization; embryo; gene expression; genetic engineering; heredity; inheritance; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; zygote; Adenoviridae; Animals; DNA, Viral; Embryo Transfer; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Engineering; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microinjections; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Pedigree; Tissue Distribution; Transcription, Genetic; Adenoviridae; Animalia; Simiae; Simian adenovirus",,,00456039,,CLDFA,6595061,"English",2-s2.0-0021751871

The increase of plasma corticosterone concentration and of the activity of rapidly (TAT, TP, SD) and slowly activating enzymes (ALT, AST) was found in F group 6-10 hr after space flight (18.5 days on biosatellite COSMOS 1129). This suggested the presence of acute-stress (associated primarily with the landing) and chronic stress induced hypercorticosteronemia during the flight. After the short 6-day period of recovery the plasma corticosterone concentrations and the activities of liver enzymes returned to control levels. The exposition of animals to repeated immobilization stress showed higher response of corticosterone levels in flight rats as compared to intact controls. No changes in basal lipolysis were observed in flight rats in comparison to intact controls, however the stimulation of lipolysis by norepinephrine was lover in animals from F and SM groups. This lower response of lipolytic processes to norepinephrine was found in flight animals also after six days period of recovery. These results showed that there are important changes in the regulation of lipolytic processes in adipose tissue of rats after space flight and in the conditions of model experiments. © 1982.",,"BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING; SPACE FLIGHT; corticosterone; enzyme; fatty acid; adipose tissue; animal; article; blood; comparative study; Cosmos 1129 Project; enzymology; Flight Experiment; immobilization; liver; male; metabolism; rat; short duration; space flight; stress; unmanned; weightlessness; Wistar rat; Cosmos 1129 Project; Flight Experiment; short duration; unmanned; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Corticosterone; Enzymes; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Immobilization; Liver; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Space Flight; Stress; Weightlessness",,,00945765,,AASTC,11541692,"English",2-s2.0-0020150259
