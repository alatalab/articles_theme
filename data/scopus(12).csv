The Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium is supported by a grant from the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund thanks to donations by the family and friends of Kathryn Sladek Smith (PPD/ RPCI.07). The scientific development and funding for this project were in part supported by the US National Cancer Institute GAME-ON Post- GWAS Initiative (U19-CA148112). This study made use of data generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control consortium. A full list of the investigators who contributed to the generation of the data is available from http://www.wtccc.org.uk/. Funding for the project was provided by the Wellcome Trust under award 076113.

(B) Magnification of area depicted by yellow dotted box in (A). Two layers of bone cells potentially osteoblasts (Obs) lining the cortical bone trabecula. The borders of the bone cell layer are depicted by the yellow dotted line. Mineral-bearing vesicles are observed inside the bone cell (white arrow head) and within the extracellular space (ECS) depicted by the yellow arrowhead. (C) Higher magnification of the extracellular mineral-bearing vesicle. Scale bars: (A) 20 μm; (B) 4 μm; (C) 1 μm.Suppl. Video 1FIB-SSV image stack showing the interface between the blood vessel and the mineralizing bone structures. The stack is composed of 497 images spanning a total thickness of approximately 10 μm. Membrane bound mineral particles observed in different tissues are depicted with colored arrowheads. Note that membrane-bound mineral particles inside osteoblasts are only faintly visible due to insufficient contrast. However some of mineral particle-bearing organelles often reminiscent of mitochondrial networks are exemplarily marked by red arrowheads. These structures are recognized as brighter tubular networks within the osteoblasts.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2015.10.009.",87563282,,BONED,"English",2-s2.0-84969674683
