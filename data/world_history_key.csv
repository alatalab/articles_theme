In contrast to the frequently stated opinion that this map projection was first operationally used by U.S. Americans it turned out that presumably the first operational maps with indication of the orthogonal UTM grid were produced by German Wehrmacht officers prior to the post World War (WW) II triumph of this projection. Based on the authors´ recent discoveries this article reveals some hitherto hardly known facts concerning the history of cartography of the 1940s. © 2016 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.","geodetic grid; map history; reference grid; UTM projection; Wehrmacht Maps","Geodesy; Maps; Geodetic grids; Global use; Map projection; Reference grids; Universal Transverse Mercator; UTM grid; UTM projection; World war; Global positioning system",,,15230406,,CGSCF,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954207614

During these past 50 years nearly 800 papers have been presented and subsequently published in the proceedings. With a 20-year rule imposed for historical presentations, the first 10 symposia concentrated on pre-World War II and early 1950s activities. A surprisingly large number of papers on early, less well-known Soviet-Russian contributions to rocketry and astronautics were presented in the first symposia, despite the ongoing Space Race between the U.S and USSR. Another important element in these symposia involved memoir papers offered by pre- and post-war rocket and astronautics pioneers from many countries, and the participation of many of these pioneers in person. In sum, the history of national space and rocket projects from some 40 countries were presented over the years in IAA History Symposia. These 50 symposia have provided a platform for scholars and professional and non-professional historians to meet and discuss the history of rocketry and astronautics, and to personally interview many space pioneers, most of whom today are deceased. Their personal recollections have since been shared with a large audience. Over time, IAA history papers divided into recognizable periods: ancient times through the 19th century, and the 20th and 21st centuries, which separate among actions and events that took place before 1945, in 1945 to 1957, and after 1957 (which marked the beginning of the space age). Proceedings of the IAA History Symposia have been published in English, ultimately in the History Series of the American Astronautical Society (AAS) and its publishing arm, Univelt Inc., under an agreement secured with the IAA. This paper presents an overview of the IAA History Symposia. It examines the early years of the history committee and its first symposium, the evolution of subsequent symposia, and it recognizes those individuals who shaped these symposia and the publication of its proceedings. © 2017 IAA",,"Biographies; Military operations; Rockets; 19th century; American Astronautical Society; International Academy of Astronautics; Space pioneers; World war II; History",,,00945765,,AASTC,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014060649

This article explains the concept's extraordinary traction by looking at the interplay of local uses and global contexts through which it emerged. Focusing on the particularly relevant setting of France, it examines the term's invention in the context of the Cold War, development thinking, and decolonization. It then analyses the review Partisans (founded in 1961), which galvanized a new radical left in France and provided a platform for a communication about, but also with, the Third World. Finally, it shows how the association Cedetim (founded in 1967) addressed migrant workers in France as 'the Third World at home'. In tracing the Third World's local-global dynamics, this article suggests a praxis-oriented approach that goes beyond famous thinkers and texts and incorporates 'lesser' intellectuals and non-textual aspects into a global conceptual history in action.

The findings suggest that the narrative generally ignores 2-way intercultural exchanges. The narrative is also Eurocentric, silencing sub–Saharan Africa’s contributions and nonmaterial influences of non-Western civilizations, such as ancient Near Eastern influences on the Judeo–Christian monotheistic tradition. Such depictions normalize a dominance paradigm that sanctions the supremacy of particular civilizations, religions, or groups. Students need to develop a reflective historical consciousness that is conducive to intergroup dynamics based on respect for diversity. Thus, in studying ancient civilizations, they should be encouraged to interrogate their own worldviews, explore the interdependence of human civilizations, and engage with omitted counternarratives, alternative chronologies, and periodization. © 2017, Routledge.

In this context, “accounting” refers to the classification of medical conditions when determining pension eligibility and awards. Pension classifications were prejudiced towards men with physical disabilities and against men with shell shock. Accounting classification’s ability to make a medical condition invisible is central to this research. The invisibility of shell shock as a medical condition in the pension classification system led to financial discrimination against men with shell shock. The immorality of this discrimination was hidden by a system of accounting classification that distanced decision-makers from the ramifications of their decisions. In addition, the Minister of Pensions adopted blame avoidance techniques to protect his Ministry and the British government from criticism occasioned by the discriminatory treatment of men with shell shock. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","accounting history; blaming; distancing; First World War; pensions; scapegoating; shell shock",,,,10323732,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012113430

First, I address Hegel’s account of the I by reconstructing its phenomenological and logical development from consciousness to self-consciousness through recognition with the other and arguing that the project of the Philosophy of Right is normative, as it provides an account of the logical process of affirmation of the I as the normative source of the realm of objective spirit. I then argue for an account of World history as the self-conscious development and liberation of the I in time and objectivity, and I consider Hegel’s philosophy of history in light of the Philosophy of Right as the historical emergence of the I through the forms of objective spirit in history. Finally, I focus on two of the allegedly most problematic issues related to Hegel’s conception of World history: the nature and very possibility of an ‘intersubjective consciousness’ and the notion of ‘World spirit’. I conclude by outlining how the conception of World history, if reconstructed in light of Hegel’s conception of the I, can have previously unnoticed political implications. © 2017 BSHP","Hegel; intersubjective consciousness; the I; World history",,,,09608788,,,,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011705797

Throughout the war, the government of William Morris Hughes had been engaged in a bitter conflict with radicals, trade unions, Irish nationalists, and members of the Labor Party over implementing the policy of military conscription. Twice the issue was put to the Australian people in a referendum, and twice it was defeated. The Hughes government saw this defeat partly as the result of the anti-conscription movement. Consequently, it had no scruples in using the intelligence services to suppress its political enemies. Within this context, this paper looks at how intelligence, throughout the conscription campaigns, became a means of suppressing political opposition and dissent. It discusses the government’s rationale for such behaviour and offers an assessment of the circumambient conditions that enabled intelligence to be used for political gain. © 2016 Journal of Intelligence History.","Australian intelligence history; conscription; Counter Espionage Bureau (CEB); military intelligence; World War One intelligence",,,,16161262,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007500684

It was eventually re-founded in 1949, continuing its tradition from its foundation in 1886, based in large part on the membership prior to 1945. Newly available archival material reveals, however, that at least six members were explicitly prevented from re-joining the society. This includes Max Clara, who was accused of plagiarism and, at least implicitly, of basing his career on Nazi party support. It also includes Eugen Fischer, a leading anthropologist of the Nazi period, who was seen to be indirectly responsible for Nazi crimes like forced sterilisation or extermination of “anthropologically defined” groups of people. Therefore, Fischer's honorary membership, which had already been published in the membership directory, was revoked after a heated internal debate. Nevertheless, these exclusions cannot be interpreted as a self-directed “denazification” of the Anatomische Gesellschaft, as political activity in line with the Nazis was not the main criterion for these exclusions. Incidentally, the archival sources also reveal that Wolfgang Bargmann, who had been elected as the first post-war secretary of the Gesellschaft in 1949, resigned from this post after only one year in office because his management of this “Fischer affair” was felt to be too autocratic. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","Anatomische Gesellschaft; Anthropology; Denazification; Eugen Fischer; Max Clara; Wolfgang Bargmann","anatomy; anthropology; career; crime; directory; Germany; human; involuntary sterilization; publishing; history; medical society; national socialism; organization and management; university; war; war crime; Anatomy; Committee Membership; Germany; History, 20th Century; National Socialism; Societies, Medical; Universities; War Crimes; World War II",,,09409602,,ANANE,27773773,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994293380

However, using search engines raises serious privacy issues as the latter gather large amounts of data about individuals through their search queries. Two main techniques have been proposed to privately query search engines. A first category of approaches, called unlinkability, aims at disassociating the query and the identity of its requester. A second category of approaches, called indistinguishability, aims at hiding user’s queries or user’s interests by either obfuscating user’s queries, or forging new fake queries. This paper presents a study of the level of protection offered by three popular solutions: Tor-based, TrackMeNot, and GooPIR. For this purpose, we present an efficient and scalable attack – SimAttack – leveraging a similarity metric to capture the distance between preliminary information about the users (i.e., history of query) and a new query. SimAttack de-anonymizes up to 36.7 % of queries protected by an unlinkability solution (i.e., Tor-based), and identifies up to 45.3 and 51.6 % of queries protected by indistinguishability solutions (i.e., TrackMeNot and GooPIR, respectively). In addition, SimAttack de-anonymizes 6.7 % more queries than state-of-the-art attacks and dramatically improves the performance of the attack on TrackMeNot by 23.6 %, while retaining an execution time faster by two orders of magnitude. © 2016, Petit et al.","Indistinguishability; Privacy; Unlinkability; Web search","Data privacy; Information retrieval; Search engines; Websites; History of queries; Indistinguishability; Large amounts of data; Orders of magnitude; Preliminary information; Query search engines; Unlinkability; Web searches; World Wide Web",,,18674828,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964253412

However, the optimal Kalman filtering solutions are subject to precise function models and statistic knowledge of noises, which may be difficult to obtain in advance. As a result, Kalman filter does not necessarily provide better performance for kinematic positioning solutions. In real world situations, a bound of the noise distribution would be easily and more reasonably determined than noise statistics. This paper studies ellipsoid bounding estimation for kinematic position estimation. In this estimation, neither process nor measurement noise characteristics are necessary, as long as the noises at each sample points can be confined in a bound (ellipsoid). A general trace criteria is adopted to choose the optimal estimator. For a the special case that only scalar measurement is available, e.g., a position measurement, we designed a modified intersection approach to reduce the estimation conservatism. Numerical results are given in each estimation step to illustrate the algorithm. A flight trajectory data is processed and the estimation results are compared under three different measurement noise cases: Gaussian white noise, uniformly noise (non-Gaussian) and the real measurement noise. Kalman filter results are also given for comparison.

The war ended the first significant era of increasing economic ties among nations and thereby shaped the economic history of the twentieth century. The war set off both a search for ways to re-create the prewar liberal world economy and attempts to create statist alternatives to it. The collapse of interbank cooperation and expansion of controls on trade, migration, and agriculture meant that economic globalization re-emerged only very slowly over the rest of the twentieth century. Indeed, the long-term effects of World War I lasted until the 1990s. The lesson of this story for the twenty-first century is to check the dangers inherent in a multipolar world, where globalization produces both economic growth and social tensions. © 2016 Berghahn Books.","Agriculture; Economic history; Globalization; Imperialism; Interbank cooperation; Migration; Tariffs; World War I",,,,03157997,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994189413

Series like Civilization (1991–present), Assassin’s Creed (2007–present), and Call of Duty (2003–present) have shown that history is a popular playground for games. Taking a step away from the historical and towards the fantastical, Valkyria Chronicles is a Japanese tactical role-playing game structured around a reframing of World War II, presenting it as a fictional conflict on an imagined continent. Though not strictly a historical game, Valkyria Chronicles nevertheless offers a case for examining playful representations of the past. In this article, Valkyria Chronicles is analyzed through the concept of selective authenticity to see how the historical connections to World War II in the game are built and maintained: which elements of the popular memory of the war are leveraged to create historical authenticity when the game in general strives towards fantasy. Reading Valkyria Chronicles as a reflection of history, this article presents the basics of how the game’s counterfactual narratives and depictions of history connect it to the established popular metanarrative about World War II, and how the game also self-reflexively comments on the susceptibility and malleability of historical facts as they are recorded and reinterpreted. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","History-based videogames; Japanese videogames; Second World War",,,,13642529,,,,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996606780

Recent studies suggest that the artichoke domestication started in Roman times, around the 1st century AD probably in Sicily; then the crop was spread by Arabs, who dominated the southern Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. The period of greatest diffusion of the artichoke starts with the Modern Age. From Naples, it was brought to Florence in 1466 by Filippo Strozzi and from Tuscany it was soon spread across the rest of Europe. Even before 1530, the artichoke was grown in southern France, while in the following decades its presence is recorded in the Languedoc, in the Loire Valley and Ile of France; in Brittany the first artichokes were grown in the gardens of the Bishop in St. Paul de Leon. In the same period, the artichoke was introduced in England, probably by the Dutch. The diffusion of the artichoke had a considerable boost in the 18th and 19th century, when the French and the Spanish emigrants brought the plant in the United States, respectively, in Louisiana and in California. Also during the 18th and 19th century when European emigrants introduced the artichoke in South America (Argentina, Chile, Peru, Brazil). Currently, the artichoke world area harvested is of 131.000 ha, spread about 45% in Europe, mainly Italy, Spain and France, 31% in Africa (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria), 16% in the Americas (Peru, Argentina, USA) and 8% in Asia (China, Turkey, Islamic Republic of Iran).

Moreover, activation rule is brought to transfer the global search to local search and suppression works for eliminating the redundancy.

One reason for this could be the lack of robustness in real world situations, especially regarding unimodal recognition technologies like speech and gesture, that tend to produce erroneous inputs that can not be detected by the subsequent multimodal input fusion mechanism. Previous work implying the possibility to detect and overcome such errors through knowledge of individual temporal behaviors has neither provided a real-time implementation nor evaluated the real benefit of such an approach. We present such an implementation of applying individual interaction histories in order to increase the robustness of multimodal inputs within a smartwatch scenario. We show how such knowledge can be created and maintained at runtime, present evaluation data from an experiment conducted in a realistic scenario, and compare the approach to the state of the art known from literature. Our approach is ready to use in other applications and existing systems, with the prospect to increase the overall robustness of future multimodal systems. © 2016 ACM.","HCI; Input error detection; Interaction history; Multimodal interaction; Robustness increase; User behavior","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer systems; Man machine systems; Real time control; Speech recognition; Interaction history; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multimodal input fusion; Multimodal inputs; Real world situations; Real-time implementations; Realistic scenario; User behaviors; Behavioral research",,,,9781450345620,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003533275

This theory predates most of the prominent pioneering texts in possible worlds semantics and anticipates the significance of its basic concept in modal logic. Prior explicitly defines modal operators as quantifiers of ‘entities’ with modal character. Although he talks about these ‘entities’ only informally, and hesitates how to name them, using alternately the phrases ‘possible states of affairs’, ‘chances’, ‘cases’ or ‘peculiar objects’, he is nevertheless very clear that they should be the fundamental concept of any theory of modality as a form of quantity. Without the assumption that modal operators quantify over such modal objects, the modal system will be incapable of distinguishing an actually true proposition from a necessarily true one. Due to the fact that Prior never made any direct reference to this theory in his subsequently published papers, it remained largely unknown. The comparison of “The Craft” with some of his papers on tense logic suggests that this early theory of modality underlies his later work on temporality. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Arthur Prior’s early modal logic; Arthur Prior’s unpublished manuscript; History of possible world semantics; Possible worlds; The Craft of Formal Logic; Theory of modality",,,,00397857,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944705231

At the time the map was engraved, navigational charts were constructed on the basis of astronomically-observed latitudes, magnetic courses and estimated distances between places. Before this information could be incorporated into the new world map it should be first transformed in such a way that the longitudinal spacings between places were restored to their correct values, as defined on the surface of the Earth. The question of whether Mercator performed such transformations or just considered that the positions were approximately correct has hitherto never been addressed in the literature. It is demonstrated in this article that Mercator was not fully aware of the complexity of the contemporary charts - which he considered to implicitly comprise a square grid of meridians and parallels - and that all planimetric information was directly imported to the novel world map without correction. It is further shown that the Mercator projection was not compatible with the navigational methods of the time.

The documentary itself explores the question of personal and public remembrance of World War Two in Cape Town. It speaks not only to the fluid and adaptive nature of memory, but also to the relative silence regarding the war in terms of public commemoration. The article discusses the challenges and rewards of film as a medium for historical argument and information and argues for an affinity between film and oral history. It provides the thinking behind the choices made in the construction of argument in a non-written discourse (film) and reveals the methods adopted in an attempt to create a complicated historical account which recognises the contingent nature of history and one which allows for a multiplicity of perspectives and voices to be heard. After discussing the making of the documentary, the article concludes that film is more than capable of creating nuanced and complicated historic arguments.

Many algorithms have been proposed based on different heuristics. There is little work on systematically examining such heuristics. In this article, we examine typical personalization heuristics based on a commercial search engine query log. We aim to provide evidence to show the necessity, potential and limitations for personalization. Specially, we utilize automated query topic classification to simulate query intents and user preferences, which ensures that our study can be conducted on large scale query log data. We examine the heuristics on query ambiguity, query intent, user preferences and their interactions. We find that only a few queries with multiple user intents are inherently ambiguous. Queries with a specific meaning also have various user intents on different query aspects. About 48% of such queries involve named entities. We introduce new metrics to measure user preferences and preference distribution. These metrics show that searchers do have their preferences and focus on only a few interested topics. We assess the potential and difficulty for personalization based on search history. The results show that users with long search history benefit more from personalization, while the difficulty is nearly the same for users with either long or short search history. These observations could provide references for potential directions of web personalization. © 2016 IJICIC Editorial Office.

For Kant, who was firmly convinced of the existence of inhabitants of other worlds, these heavens were inhabited. He is certain that 'If it were possible to settle by any sort of experience whether there are inhabitants of at least some of the planets that we see, I might well bet everything that I have on it. Hence I say that it is not merely an opinion but a strong belief (on the correctness of which I would wager many advantages in life) that there are also inhabitants of other worlds.' In this statement by Kant in no less a work than the Critique of Pure Reason one can, on the one hand, recognize a reflection of Kant's earlier convictions and expositions, on the other hand, the context of the citation and the contemporary background are, of course, relevant. Following the example of Kant, this paper investigates the meaning of such reflections about inhabitants of alien worlds, which due to advances in planetary astronomy are today again on the agenda.

Its paradoxical mixture of mammalian, avian and reptilian characteristics made it something of a taxonomic conundrum. In the early 1820s Robert Jameson (1774–1854), the professor of natural history at the University of Edinburgh and the curator of the University's natural history museum, was able to acquire three valuable specimens of this species. He passed one of these on to the anatomist Robert Knox (1791–1862), who dissected the animal and presented his results in a series of papers to the Wernerian Natural History Society, which later published them in its Memoirs. This paper takes Jameson's platypus as a case study on how natural history specimens were used to create and contest knowledge of the natural world in the early nineteenth century, at a time when interpretations of the relationships between animal taxa were in a state of flux. It shows how Jameson used his possession of this interesting specimen to provide a valuable opportunity for his protégé Knox while also helping to consolidate his own position as a key figure in early nineteenth-century natural history. © 2016 The Author(s).

These new sites were supposed to broadcast the power and interests of colonial states and societies. Yet, Africans and people of African descent left indelible marks on modern urban life. Research has demonstrated that cities, even in the metropole, were transformed by enslaved women and men, immigrants, refugees, and laborers. These articles discuss the ways women and men shaped cities as property-owners, litigants, activists, and intellectuals and engaged broader questions of identity, belonging, and citizenship. People circulating through the Atlantic world also inhabited cities as gendered, sexual, and affective beings who actively conceptualized ideas about pleasure, morality, respectability, and desire. These articles on New Orleans, Louisiana; East London, South Africa; Marseille, France; and Dakar, Senegal reveal unique approaches that integrate gender and urban studies in an Atlantic world context that considers connections between Africa, the Americas, and Europe.

Those who are troubled by this have sought to rethink the concept such that one can ‘think with’ modernity, while avoiding, or even challenging, Eurocentrism. This article surveys some such attempts, before moving on to argue that the question of whether modernity is principally a European phenomenon or not cannot be adequately framed without considering the knowledge within which the question comes to be posed; for the knowledge through which we represent and understand modernity is itself, in its origins, European (and modern), and thus the relations between this knowledge and the ‘real’ that it purports to characterize, also need to be interrogated. Doing so, the article suggests, complicates the task of understanding modernity in non-Eurocentric terms, and leads to the recognition that the concept of modernity is not simply a means by which we describe, grasp or apprehend a phenomenon external to it, but that it is itself involved in the production of the modern. If this is so, we are (West and non-West) modern, though not in the way that we have hitherto presumed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","colonial; colonialism; Eurocentric; Eurocentrism; global; history; modern; modernity; postcolonial theory; world history",,,,17499755,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84985905946

As the machinery changes, epistemic practices also change. A case in point is how the epistemic practices of historians are reconfigured by the introduction of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We argue that GIS mediates historical understanding and knowledge creation in at least three ways: (a) by allowing historians to bring new sets of data into analysis, (b) by introducing novel questions, fresh insights, and new modes of analysis and reasoning, or discovering new answers to older questions; and (c) by providing new tools for historians to communicate with each other and with their audiences. We illustrate these mediations through the study of the historiography of Budapest Ghettos during World War II.

As evidenced by the recent historiographical review of First World War literature in the pages of the Canadian Historical Review, Canadian scholars ought to adopt a similar framework to unite two literatures that separately focus on the military history and social history of the war. Papineau's 1916 letter provides a glimpse into how a soldier expressed his perspective of the war from the frontlines and participated in the mobilization of Canada's war culture. His writing was a result of his war experience, but Papineau wrote it for a Canadian audience at home, and its wide publication exposed his views to millions across Canada and Britain. Papineau urged Canadian citizens (specifically French Canadians) to support the purpose and value of the war as understood by Canadian soldiers.

Since 2004, South Korean universities have jumped in WoS publications and global university rankings. This article argues that, in the past, Korea was characterized at all hierarchical levels by personal favoritism. But the military government that seized power in the 1960s used a rigorous system of quantified exports, wherein companies meeting export targets were rewarded. The system enabled South Korea to break the vicious circle of personal favoritism in the manufacturing sector of the economy. In its academic institutions, meanwhile, personal favoritism remained rampant and Korean scholars were clearly underperforming. In the late 1990s, South Korea sought reform of higher education, as part of a shift to a knowledge-based economy. In reforming higher education, the country copied the export strategy that had succeeded in advancing the production of manufactured goods. The government used the WoS and, later, global university rankings to reward productive scholars and punish unproductive ones. The system of quantified exports used in higher education was successful in filtering out free-riders and rent-seekers, minimizing bureaucratic costs, promoting English as a lingua franca in academia, and promoting globalization in scholarship. The system might be counterproductive in the long run, however, for a number of reasons. © 2016, Atlas Economic Research Foundation.

We applied this conceptual framework of mutual constitution in a research project using quantitative and qualitative approaches to understand the dynamic resonance between sociocultural variance in Black History Month (BHM) representations and the reproduction of racial inequality in the U.S. In studies 1 and 2, we considered whether mainstream BHM artifacts reflect the preferences and understandings of White Americans (i.e., psychological constitution of cultural worlds). Consistent with the psychological constitution hypothesis, White American participants reported more positive affect, better recognition, and greater liking for BHM representations from the schools where White Americans were the majority than BHM representations from the schools where Black students and other students of color were the majority. Moreover, as an indication of the identity relevance of BHM representations, White identification was more positively associated with judgments of positive affect and preference in response to BHM representations from White schools than BHM representations from the schools where Black students were in the majority. In studies 3 and 4, we considered whether BHM representations from different settings differentially afford support or opposition to anti-racism policies (i.e., cultural constitution of psychological experience). In support of the cultural constitution hypothesis, BHM representations typical of schools where Black students were in the majority were more effective at promoting support for anti-racism policies compared to BHM representations typical of predominately White schools and a control condition. This effect was mediated by the effect of (different) BHM representations on perception of racism. Together, these studies suggest that representations of Black History constitute cultural affordances that, depending on their source, can promote (or impede) perception of racism and anti-racism efforts. This research contributes to an emerging body of work examining the bidirectional, psychological importance of cultural products.

Exposure to these compounds remains poorly characterized in developing countries, despite the fact that certain behaviors related to westernization have the potential to influence exposure.The aim of this pilot study was to measure urinary concentrations of BPA, six different benzophenones and four parabens in 34 Tunisian women. In addition, we identified some socio-demographic and dietary predictors of exposure to these compounds. Chemical analyses were carried out by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (UHPLC-MS/MS). Detection frequencies of methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP) and propylparaben (PP) ranged between 67.6 and 94.1%. Butylparaben (BP) was found in 38.2% of the analyzed samples; BPA in 64.7%; and benzophenone-1 (BP-1) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) were detected in 91.2 and 64.7% of the analyzed samples, respectively. Urinary geometric mean concentrations of MP, EP, PP, and BP were 30.1, 1.4, 2.0 and 0.5 ng mL-1, respectively. Geometric mean concentrations of BPA, BP-1, and BP-3 were 0.4, 1.3 and 1.1 ng mL-1, respectively.Our results suggest that Tunisian women are widely exposed to BPA, parabens and some benzophenones.

Nevertheless, while the Second World War was a global event, its memories have been mainly studied from a national point of view, thus underestimating the conspicuous phenomena of transmission of narratives and representations of the conflict from one country to another. This article analyzes the Italian reception of American movies about the Second World War, as a way to overcome the preponderance of a nation-centered perspective and to open up to a transnational analysis mainly based on the concepts of communication, diffusion and exportation of cultural products. After a theoretical introduction, the article analyzes an original source of great use for the study of the reception of American movies: the evaluation forms produced by the audience of an Italian cineforum about five American war movies in the 1960s. The importance of the source lies in its rarity: direct testimonies of the opinion of a non-specialist public about a movie are very rare, and thus extremely precious for a bottom-up approach to such issues. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural history; Italian history; memory; movies; reception studies; Second World War",,,,1354571X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988346556

In particular, they sought to avoid heavy-handed treatment by qa'ids and local elites who applied disease control measures without appropriate medical knowledge.

The conflict was experienced as an incomprehensible and terrifying chaos; those most aware of the situation (Swahili merchants and allied chiefs) fled with the Germans. The initially very brutal Belgian occupation of Burundi represented a new shock for the population, especially because of the effects of forced recruitments of porters for the military campaign in East Africa.

However, it is also common knowledge that Einstein was strongly influenced by Hume, who rejected the necessity of a causal connection. Thus Einstein's stance seems internally incongruent. This apparent incoherence is resolved if (1) Einstein changed his mind after constructing the relativity theory or (2) Einstein agreed with Hume concerning space and time, but disagreed concerning causality. In this paper, I argue that both (I) and (2) are false. Nevertheless, I argue that Einstein's attitude is not inconsistent by showing that Hume did not reject the use of causality in science (rather, he considered it essential for science), and that, while Einstein admitted the limits of causality as a concept, he nevertheless believed that physics could not function without it.","Early history of quantum mechanics; Influence of hume to Einstein; Necessity of causal connection; Non-locality; Reality of quantum world",,"26370021, JSPS, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","This work has supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant No. 26370021) and Qdai-jamp Research Program.",02854821,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997112231

Both primarily impact display advertising (as opposed to search and native social ads), and affect how retailers reach customers and how content producers earn revenue. It is, however, unclear what the consequences of these trends are. We investigate using anonymized web browsing histories of 14 million individuals, focusing on ""retail sessions"" in which users visit online sites that sell goods and services. We find that only 3% of retail sessions are initiated by display ads, a figure that is robust to permissive attribution rules and consistent across widely varying market segments. We further estimate the full distribution of how retail sessions are initiated, and find that search advertising is three times more important than display advertising to retailers, and search advertising is itself roughly three times less important than organic web search. Moving to content providers, we find that display ads are shown by 12% of websites, accounting for 32% of their page views; this reliance is concentrated in online publishing (e.g., news outlets) where the rate is 91%. While most consumption is either in the long-tail of websites that do not show ads, or sites like Facebook that show native, first-party ads, moderately sized web publishers account for a substantial fraction of consumption, and we argue that they will be most affected by changes in the display advertising market. Finally, we use estimates of ad rates to judge the feasibility of replacing lost ad revenue with a freemium or donation-based model.","Ad blocking; Competition; Do-not-track; E-commerce; Privacy","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Data privacy; Economics; Electronic commerce; Marketing; Sales; Websites; Ad blocking; Browsing history; Content producers; Content providers; Display advertisings; Do-not-track; Online advertising; Online publishing; World Wide Web",,,,9781450339360,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983527024

To cater for a user's specific information needs, personalized QAC strategies use a searcher's search history and their profile. Is personalization consistently effective in different search contexts? We study the QAC problem by selectively personalizing the query completion list. Based on a lenient personalized QAC strategy that encodes the ranking signal as a trade-off between query popularity and search context, we propose a model for selectively personalizing query auto-completion (SP-QAC) to study this trade-off. We predict effective trade-offs based on a regression model, where the typed query prefix, clicked documents and preceding queries in the same session are used to weigh personalization in QAC.

They have largely been overlooked in Australian history and memory of the conflict with the result that little is known of their time in captivity or of its wider ramifications. In examining the emotional impact of their capture and imprisonment, this article offers intimate insights into how these Australian POWs felt about their captivity, from the moment of surrender until long after the war had ended. The humiliation of capture and confinement at the hands of a culturally, religiously and linguistically different enemy and the restrictions imposed by wartime imprisonment exacerbated the prisoners’ private feelings of shame and failure, feelings that were publicly reinforced in the aftermath of the war as the two dominant narratives of the conflict-the heroic Anzac fighter and the Turks as the honourable enemy-excluded or, at best, marginalised their experiences. Such analysis tells us much about the psychological dimension of wartime captivity, and adds to our understanding of the legacy of this POW experience. © 2016 International Australian Studies Association.","Australian history; First world war; Military history; Prisoners of war; War and society",,,,14443058,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982899576

Proper monitoring and management can guarantee their protection from multiple threats. In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) was used to assess criteria layers acquired from the data available in the literature. A conceptual model for determining the priority area for monitoring in Bogda, China, was created based on outstanding universal values (OUV) and expert knowledge. Weights were assigned to each layer using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on group decisions, encompassing three experts: one being a heritage site expert, another a forest ranger, and the other a heritage site manager. Subsequently, evaluation layers and constraint layers were used to generate a priority map and to determine the feasibility of monitoring in Bogda. Finally, a monitoring suitability map of Bogda was obtained by referencing priority and feasibility maps. The high-priority monitoring area is located in the montane forest belt, which exhibits high biodiversity and is the main tourist area of Bogda. The northern buffer zone of Bogda comprises the concentrated feasible monitoring areas, and the area closest to roads and monitoring facilities is highly feasible for NWHS monitoring. The suitability of an area in terms of monitoring is largely determined by the monitoring priority in that particular area. The majority of planned monitoring facilities are well distributed in both suitable and less suitable areas. Analysis results indicate that the protection of Bogda will be more scientifically based due to its effective and all-around planned monitoring system proposed by the declaration text of Xinjiang Tianshan, which is the essential file submitted to World Heritage Centre to inscribe as a NWHS. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bogda; GIS-MCDA; Monitoring; Natural World Heritage Sites; Optimization","Analytic hierarchy process; Biodiversity; Decision making; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Optimization; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Bogda; Conceptual model; Expert knowledge; Heritage sites; Monitoring and management; Monitoring system; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Monitoring; analytical hierarchy process; biodiversity; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; GIS; montane forest; multicriteria analysis; optimization; World Heritage Site; Bogda Mountains; China; Tien Shan; Tien Shan; Xinjiang Uygur; China; decision support system; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; geographic information system; history; procedures; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Support Techniques; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Geographic Information Systems; History",,,01676369,,EMASD,27251219,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973325082

My aim is not to move around historical posts; rather I propose a different way of understanding Romanian history as such. This is the research agenda. I seek to write a world history from the perspective of a peripheral place like Romania has been. Therefore, this is not simply an attempt to insert a local, neglected, silenced or distorted history into a wider, European, global story (that is, to discover the history of “people without history”), just as it is not another attempt to “provincialize Europe” in favour of a view from its repressed margins. Instead, following Coronil (2004), I believe it is indispensable to globalize the periphery, to understand its worldwide formation. My investigation draws upon the conceptual toolkit of world-system theory and its underlining philosophy of history (Wallerstein, 2011). In the same vein, the guiding principles of my periodization elaborate on Andre Gunder Frank’s insight that the exchange (or rather direct transfer) of surplus between societies is what links regions and societies as whole (Frank, 1978). The focus then shifts from a given society/state and its internal relations to the wider world-system, or world-economy, in which it is embedded. The unit of analysis is not a geographical location, but relations and networks and their historical development. © 2016, Babes-Bolyai University.

One of those who discussed the new scientific worldview and its implications for theology was the Swedish natural philosopher and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. This article discusses Swedenborg's astrotheological transformation, his use of theological arguments in his early cosmology, and his cosmogony that later on ended up in his use of contemporary natural philosophy in his theology, especially concerning the question of the plurality of worlds. I will first sketch the astrotheology found in his natural philosophical works, and then turn to the astrotheology of his later spiritual teachings. In Swedenborg's works we find teleological arguments and a stress on the universality of the divine creation and Christianity, as well as anthropomorphic descriptions of extraterrestrial life. By reconciling contemporary astronomical ideas, among others the concept of the plurality of worlds, with Christian dogmas, Swedenborg refuted deistic conclusions that Jesus was merely a mortal, while at the same time keeping his belief in the modern astronomical worldview. © 2016 Joint Publication Board of Zygon.","Astrotheology; Eighteenth century; Emanuel Swedenborg; Extraterrestrial life debate; History of astrobiology; History of astronomy; Physico-theology; Plurality of worlds; Teleology",,,,05912385,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964940201

This article draws on both primary and secondary sources to propose a theory of Chinese history that is more sinocentric, cyclical, and open-ended. The theory takes seriously the well-known Chinese emphasis on establishing and maintaining cultural centrality and Chinese interest in learning from the past to influence the present and shape the future. It argues that these concerns have resulted in a spiral or helical pattern of Chinese historical development. It goes on to suggest that the Chinese spiral might help us to conceptualize world history in a way that respects all peoples of the world and all periods of history from the origins of our subspecies to the present. History is in one sense what actually happened in the past and historiography is how people interpret it to meet present needs and realize future aspirations. Given acceleration in the pace of change and expansion in the arena of action, historians can tell us little about what to expect in the future, but they may enhance the range of possibilities by bringing to light various past experiences. In this article I examine how the Chinese experience might assist us in fashioning a more peaceful, just, and sustainable world order. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","centrality; Chinese history; culture states; historiography; world history",,,,16733401,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979086847

Background: Childhood abuse and intimate partner violence have each been associated with migraine headaches in previous studies, but these associations have not been explored among pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among a cohort of 2970 pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. History of childhood abuse (ie, physical or sexual abuse) was assessed using the Childhood Physical and Sexual Abuse Questionnaire. Intimate partner violence (IPV) was assessed using the World Health Organization questionnaire. Migraine classification (including migraine and probable migraine) was based on International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-III beta criteria. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: The prevalence of any migraine was 33.5% while approximately 70% of participants reported a history of childhood abuse and 36.7% a history of IPV. Women with a history of any childhood abuse had a 38% increased odds of any migraine compared to women with no history of childhood abuse (OR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.15-1.64). The odds of migraine increased with increasing numbers of experienced childhood abuse events (Ptrend &lt;.001). Additionally, after adjusting for confounders women with a history of IPV had a 43% increased odds of any migraine as compared to women without intimate partner violence (OR = 1.43; 95%CI 1.02-2.02). Women with a joint positive history of childhood abuse and IPV, as compared with the reference group, had a 88% increased odds of migraine (aOR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.51-2.35).

We hypothesized that virtual reality therapy (VRT) for OGA would improve the functional connectivity (FC) of the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit by stimulating the limbic system. Methods: Twenty-four adults with OGA were randomly assigned to a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) group or VRT group. Before and after the four-week treatment period, the severity of OGA was evaluated with Young's Internet Addiction Scale (YIAS). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and FC from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed to other brain areas were evaluated. Twelve casual game users were also recruited and underwent only baseline assessment. Results: After treatment, both CBT and VRT groups showed reductions in YIAS scores. At baseline, the OGA group showed a smaller ALFF within the right middle frontal gyrus and reduced FC in the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit. In the VRT group, connectivity from the PCC seed to the left middle frontal and bilateral temporal lobe increased after VRT. Conclusion: VRT seemed to reduce the severity of OGA, showing effects similar to CBT, and enhanced the balance of the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Amplitude low-frequency fluctuation; Cortico-striatal-limbic circuit; Functional connectivity; Online gaming addiction; Virtual reality therapy","Brain; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroimaging; Online systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Virtual reality; Baseline assessment; Cognitive-behavior therapies; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Internet addiction; Low Frequency Fluctuations; On-line gaming; Virtual reality therapies; Functional neuroimaging; adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical article; cognitive therapy; controlled study; disease severity; DSM-IV-TR; functional magnetic resonance imaging; health program; human; intermethod comparison; internet addiction; male; medical history; middle frontal gyrus; neuroimaging; online gaming addiction; posterior cingulate; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders; treatment duration; virtual reality exposure therapy; world health organization",,,01692607,,CMPBE,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956866118

In 2014, malaria burden in Brazil (143,910 microscopically confirmed cases and 41 malaria-related deaths) has reached its lowest levels in 35 years, Plasmodium falciparum is highly focal, and the geographic boundary of transmission has considerably shrunk. Transmission in Brazil remains entrenched in the Amazon Basin, which accounts for 99.5 % of the country's malaria burden. This paper reviews major lessons learned from past and current malaria control policies in Brazil. A comprehensive discussion of the scientific and logistic challenges that may impact malaria elimination efforts in the country is presented in light of the launching of the Plan for Elimination of Malaria in Brazil in November 2015. Challenges for malaria elimination addressed include the high prevalence of symptomless and submicroscopic infections, emerging anti-malarial drug resistance in P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax and the lack of safe anti-relapse drugs, the largely neglected burden of malaria in pregnancy, the need for better vector control strategies where Anopheles mosquitoes present a highly variable biting behaviour, human movement, the need for effective surveillance and tools to identify foci of infection in areas with low transmission, and the effects of environmental changes and climatic variability in transmission. Control actions launched in Brazil and results to come are likely to influence control programs in other countries in the Americas. © 2016 The Author(s).","Brazil; Malaria; Malaria control; Malaria control challenges; Malaria elimination","antimalarial agent; artemether plus benflumetol; artemisinin; artesunate plus mefloquine; chloroquine; chlorphenotane; doxycycline; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; insecticide; mefloquine; primaquine; pyrimethamine plus sulfadoxine; quinine; tafenoquine; tetracycline; Anopheles; Anopheles arabiensis; Anopheles darlingi; Anopheles gambiae; antimalarial drug resistance; bed net; Brazil; bromeliad malaria; climate change; disease surveillance; environmental change; environmental factor; high risk pregnancy; history of medicine; human; insecticide treated bed net; long lasting insecticide treated bed net; malaria; malaria control; malaria falciparum; malaria in pregnancy; nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; parasite load; pesticide spraying; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium malariae; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; polymerase chain reaction; practice guideline; pregnancy; Review; serology; species distribution; species diversity; vector control; world health organization","NIAID, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; U19 AI089681, NIH, National Institutes of Health","Recent field studies reviewed here have been funded by grants from the research grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), (U19 AI089681 to Joseph M.

This article examines how the Second World War created conditions favouring the emergence of indigenous identity as a global concept. Using a comparative perspective, this paper considers two ways in which war conditions affected indigenous peoples: by highlighting issues of citizenship, loyalty and military service; and by altering how combatant powers evaluated indigenous cultures. While the experiences of particular groups varied widely, the wartime era focused attention on both policies of assimilation and assertions of distinctiveness, creating a fluid context for change. A global, comparative perspective offers insight into the role of the war era in understanding the relationship between indigenous activism and the international order. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","assimilation; citizenship; history; identity; Indigenous peoples; World War II",,,,1070289X,,,,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969166552

Inspired by Michael Rothberg’s concept of multidirectional memory, this article examines multidirectional narratives in history textbooks: narratives that combine different histories, places and times in a productive way. They generate new meanings by combining histories and help us understand new, unknown situations by putting them in familiar frames of reference. The study of multidirectional textbook narratives precisely brings to light how authors make sense of the past and how continuity and meaning interact with interpretations of the present and the future. The analysis of multidirectional textbook narratives enables textbook researchers to examine how past experiences and future expectations are organised. To illustrate this, this article examines how textbook authors generated continuity and meaning by establishing narrative links between the past, the present and the future in English history textbooks for 11- to 14-year-old students in the 1920-1960 period. A case study presents the English defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588: how and why does the narration of the 1588 event interact with the narration of other historical events, and do these interactions change after the Second World War?. © 2016 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.","Cultural memory; History textbooks; Multidirectional textbook narratives; The second world war; The Spanish Armada",,,,00309230,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964252295

Charles Bean struggled from the earliest days of the war to get Australian film, shot by Australian cinematographers, into Australian hands – with limited success. Using the 1919 report Charles Bean wrote on his dealings with the War Office Cinematograph Committee (WOCC) as a framing device, this paper traces some of the paths taken by the earliest of these fragile records. By using three films as case studies, exploring the history of the WOCC and its major players and drawing on (and pulling apart) contemporary correspondence, diaries and notes a chaotic picture emerges. Though Bean himself is not without sin in the mishandling of the Australian footage, his fight for these first few films highlights the constant tension between film as a content-driven commodity and film as an archival object. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australian film history; Charles bean; film archives; First World War",,,,17503175,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975321751

The schedule contains tasks, work items, and resources assigned to carry out the tasks. Current state-of-the-art monitoring involves methods such as Gantt charts and spreadsheets/tables to display and analyze the project schedule, tasks and resources information PMBOK (2004). These methods, however, have certain limitations. It is difficult to see the entire schedule in a single view and analyze the tasks and resources especially in the case of large data. There is also little support for interacting with the data, and the Gantt chart does not show history information and trends. In this paper, we develop an approach that uses 3D visualizations to represent information about project tasks and resources, to overcome the above limitations. To assess our approach, we conduct an empirical study on real-world projects using 42 participants from both academia and industry. We developed a prototype tool named 3DProjView for the study. The study compared the effectiveness and efficiency of using 3D visualizations versus Gantt chart and tables. The results indicate that participants using 3D visualizations achieved an average of 40% higher accuracy and spent on average 39% less time analyzing project tasks and resources, further indicating that our approach effectively helps project managers in both accuracy and efficiency for monitoring project performance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The questionnaire inquired the crawling behaviour of the child, as well as demographic and socio-economic factors, pre-, peri- And postnatal factors, the child's medical history, gross motor development, playing and sleeping position and family history and environmental factors. Differences in inquired factors between the different forms of crawling were investigated using a one-way ANOVA or a Chi square test.

Bottom shufflersachieved the milestones of rolling over, independent standing and independent walking with an average delay of almost 2 months. Bottom shufflers also showed significantly less tummy-time after the age of 8 months and the prevalence of orthopaedic problems is almost three times as high. Bottom shuffling seems to be related to a delay in independent walking, although the mean age at which walking is achieved (15,3 months old) is still within the norms presented by the World Health Organisation. Possibly the delay is related to insufficient trunk control as differences are also observed in the milestones of rolling over and in the amount of tummy time.",,"analysis of variance; behavior; chi square test; child; cohort analysis; environmental factor; family; family study; human; infant; medical history; motor development; potential difference; prevalence; questionnaire; sleep; trunk; walking; world health organization",,,0371683X,,TGEKB,,"Dutch",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964226752

Although no single account is sufficient to explain the governance misadventures, one key point resonating is that progress and development have proved elusive over the years. In this article, we seek to move away from the dominant characterization of this governance crisis as deriving directly from the consequences of a monolithic oil economy, a deeply fractured and volatile political terrain, or even corrupt and patrimonial rule. Instead, the article locates the root of Nigeria’s governance crisis in the queer pattern of the emergence, reinvention, and manipulation of proto-nationalisms characterized not by any nationalistic quest for independence and spatial liberation but one pursued to gain foothold in governance and to partake in its perquisites. Invariably, the post-colonial nation-states that emerged at independence in many African countries, for the most part, neither followed through with any logical expression of genuine nationalism nor mobilized toward a shared vision of nationhood. The article shows how individuals and groups within the polity soon became locked in contested and irreconcilable positions that further made the construction of a truly nationalistic identity difficult, if not forlorn. This article submits that successive post-colonial administrations unimaginatively followed the divide-and-rule traditions of the colonial state and thus failed to mobilize the popular support required for the construction of a broad-based national identity that is key to managing the protracted governance crises the country has experienced since independence. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Africa; and social conflict; area studies; comparative politics; comparative/historical sociology; economic science; ethnicity and politics; humanities; intersectional politics; peace; political economy; political economy of the world-system; political history; political science; political sociology; politics and humanities; rationality and society; social movements and activism; social sciences; sociological theory; sociology; war",,,,21582440,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977518826

A comparison of the sociolinguistic trajectories of Syriac Christians in North Iraq, Jews in Baghdad and Catholic Christians in Palestine suggests that Arabic’s function of undergirding the ‘Arab states’ thrived on earlier interpretations of Arabic as the language of interregional and interdenominational contacts and as the language of cultural, societal and political modernization rather than on exclusivist nationalist, ethnic or linguistic identifications. Put differently, the increased use of Arabic by those who also had other languages at their disposal resulted from the combination of pragmatism with commitment to societal modernization and inclusive nationalism. The linguistic trajectories of these three groups are analysed against the background of a rereading of George Antonius’ The Arab Awakening (1938) as a contemporary source for the rise of Arab nationalism among non-Muslim minorities. © 2016 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.",,"Arab world; Christianity; cultural history; cultural landscape; Judaism; language; modernization; Ottoman empire; post-war; social inclusion; Iraq; Palestine",,,13530194,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958601962

Tivoli, Avenue Max Buset 34, La Louvière, Cote d'Ivoire","Nowadays, Hippocrate, "" The Father of Medicine "", still influences our medicine. He was famous because of the great medical corpus texts preserved in his name. Only recently, our universities have updated the famous Hippocratic Oath to avoid contradictions with our modern ethics. Hippocrate was a great clinician but a poor anatomist. Hippocratical humourism remained accurate until the age of the enlightenment (18th century). Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish medicine from philosophy in Greek antiquity. So we have to contextualize Greek ancient medicine in this philosophical field. In the 3rd century before Christus (BC), the centre of gravity in medicine shifted to Alexandria. Indeed, a famous academic library was created in 288 BC. At the same time, dissection of human cadavers was authorized until the first century BC. This enabled the evolution of the knowledge in anatomy and physiology. Rome was still polytheistic population until the end of ancient times. Rome integrated Greek gods in his pantheon. Asclepios became Aesculapius. Rome despises physicians in the first ancient age of Rome. The family's father provided medical cares. A lot of Greek physicians settled then in Rome. Again, roman medicine grew in parallel with philosophical trends. These trends were called "" sects "" but in fact, they were rather medical schools. In this review, we will especially talk about three physicians of this period : Aurelius Cornelius Celsus, Aréteé of Cappadocia and Galenus of Pergamon. Thereafter, medical knowledge did not really change significantly until Renaissance period.","Alexandria; Antiquity; Greece; History; Pneumology; Rome","cultural anthropology; history; human; pulmonology; Greek World; History, Ancient; Humans; Pulmonary Medicine; Roman World",,,00353639,,RMBXA,27487699,"French",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982918644

The development of successive commodity frontiers gave way to long waves of economic expansion that have been pivotal to accelerating accumulation and transcending capital's recurrent crises. In short, commodity frontiers are constitutive of world-ecological moments premised on booms and crises of accumulation. In this paper, I examine the coal commodity frontier in Appalachia, to illustrate the region's history as one of succeeding frontiers in and out of the region over the long twentieth century of American capitalism. I argue that the origin of Appalachia's coal frontier was decisively made through the nineteenth-century agricultural revolution expressed outside of the region. Appalachia's full-fledged development was an outcome of capital's under-reproduction strategies. The crisis of the region's frontier turned on a lack of surplus from under-reproduction strategies, competing coal basins, economic diversification and competing energy sources. I find that the commodity frontier concept not only illuminates regional political economies and ecologies of difference, but also explains the production of nature of historical capitalism. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Coal; Commodity frontier; Environmental history; Historical geography; World-systems analysis","capitalism; coal; commodity market; economic history; environmental history; historical geography; Appalachians",,,14710358,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961927489

The second part of the paper involves an estimate of the probability of the previous scenario, guided by the principle that the actual world is the mean (PAM) and using computer simulations to create possible worlds in which the time spans between advances is varied according to a gamma distribution function. Taking into account the importance of the use of the diaphragm for the invention of the telescope, the probability that the telescope were built by 1538 for a branching time at 1510 is found to be smaller than 1%.

Such an analysis is also a way of reinterpreting the dawn of IR as a discipline, its debates and tensions, its present transformations.

It is also a way of shedding light on what could be considered, in such a chaos, the French approach to International Relations. Is it only the French touch or the basis of a new paradigm? The article criticises the previous domination of American realism, which was built on an essentially conflictual vision of international interactions. While, throughout history several alternative approaches attempted to challenge Realism, they appeared too weak to do so in a meaningful way.

We describe two approaches for performing the session aggregation: fixed-length sessions and variable-length sessions. We also describe an approach for identifying repetitive pattern of life behaviour and show how such patterns can be extracted and represented as binary strings. Using the Jaccard similarity coefficient, a session-to-session comparison can be performed and the sessions can be analysed to determine to what extent a particular session is similar to any other session in the Internet history, and thus is highly likely to correspond to the same user. Experiments have been conducted using two sets of test data, where multiple users have access to the same computer. By identifying patterns of Internet usage that are unique to each user, our approach exhibits a high success rate in attributing particular sessions of the Internet history to the correct user. This can provide considerable help to a forensic investigator trying to establish which user was using the computer when a web-related crime was committed. © 2016 The Authors.

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that female sex independently predicted clinically relevant chest pain at 1- and 2-year follow-up both during daily activities and at minimum physical exertion/at rest (1 year adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 2.4; p = 0.002; and adjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.5; p < 0.001; 2-year adjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.6; p < 0.001; and adjusted OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.3; p = 0.001). Nevertheless, the 2-year rates of death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, stent thrombosis, and various composite clinical endpoints were similar for both sexes. Conclusions Although the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events was low and similar for both sexes, women showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of clinically relevant chest pain, which might be largely related to mechanisms other than epicardial coronary obstruction. © 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.","chest pain; newer generation drug-eluting stent(s); percutaneous coronary intervention; randomized clinical trial; second-generation drug-eluting stent(s); sex analysis","polymer; adult; aged; Article; diabetes mellitus; drug eluting coronary stent; drug eluting stent; family history; female; heart infarction; human; hypertension; implantation; major clinical study; male; material coating; mortality; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); revascularization; sex difference; stent thrombosis; thorax pain","Medtronic; Medtronic; Medtronic; Medtronic; Medtronic",,19368798,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959258869

Using primary sources from the Ottoman and British archives, it argues that the Ottoman Empire developed a ‘politics of negotiation’ towards the tribes in its attempt to secure cities and major pilgrimage and trade routes against tribal attack. The principal agents of the empire who made this negotiated governance possible were the amir of Mecca and the governor of Hijaz. As a result of this policy, imperial authorities had to give significant concessions to the tribes, and they thus incorporated them into the province's imperial order. When the Ottoman economy went through a crisis, as in the 1900s, negotiated governance and order faced great problems. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","History; late Ottoman history; middle east history","Arab world; historical perspective; negotiation process; Ottoman empire; political power; Middle East",,,00263206,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960348214

In commemoration of 100 years since WW1, this study uses retrospective data to report on the oral health of NZ service personnel.METHODS: 325 Pākehā, 165 Māori and 150 Samoan male recruits who served in the NZ Expeditionary Force between 1914 and 1918 were randomly selected and their personnel files accessed through Archives New Zealand.RESULTS: The oral health of recruits was described as 'good' for 44%, 'pass' for 38%, 'pass with false teeth' for 5% and 'poor' for 13%. Dental health was documented at enlistment for a decreasing proportion of soldiers as the war progressed, dropping from 96% during 1914-15, to 54% in 1916 and 22% in 1917-18 (p < 0.001). Significantly more soldiers who enlisted in 1917-18 had poor dental health (44%) than those who enlisted during 1916 (20%) and 1914-15 (8%) (p < 0.001). By ethnicity, Māori had the best dental health, followed by Samoan and Pākehā recruits (p < 0.001). On average, dental health was poorer among the lower ranks and among recruits of low socio-economic status; and soldiers from major cities had better oral health than those from rural areas; however, these differences were not statistically significant in this sample.CONCLUSIONS: Enlistment criteria appear to have been loosened as the war progressed, perhaps to accept more soldiers into service. Poor oral health was reported for approximately 1 in 7 accepted recruits.

Experimental tests have led to first conclusions about the dangerousness of an impact observing impact forces or displacement time history with PMHS (Post Mortem human Subjects). They have allowed providing interesting data for the development and the validation of numerical biomechanical models. These models, widely used in the framework of automotive crashworthiness, have led to the development of numerical-based injury criteria and tolerance thresholds. The aim of this process is to improve the safety of mechanical structures in interaction with the body. In a military context, investigations both at experimental and numerical level are less successfully completed. For both military and civil frameworks, the literature list a number of numerical analysis trying to propose injury mechanisms, and tolerance thresholds based on biofidelic Finite Element (FE) models of different part of the human body. However the link between both frameworks is not obvious, since lots of parameters are different: great mass impacts at relatively low velocity for civil impacts (falls, automotive crashworthiness) and low mass at very high velocity for military loadings (ballistic, blast). In this study, different accident cases were investigated, and replicated with a previously developed and validated FE model of the human thorax named Hermaphrodite Universal Biomechanical YX model (HUBYX model). These previous validations included replications of standard experimental tests often used to validate models in the context of automotive industry, experimental ballistic tests in high speed dynamic impact and also numerical replication of blast loading test ensuring its biofidelity. In order to extend the use of this model in other frameworks, some real-world accidents were reconstructed, and consequences of these loadings on the FE model were explored. These various numerical replications of accident coming from different contexts raise the question about the ability of a FE model to correctly predict several kinds of trauma, from blast or ballistic impacts to falls, sports or automotive ones in a context of numerical injury mechanisms and tolerance limits investigations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D Finite Element Analysis; Accident reconstruction; Biomechanics; Blast; Free fall; Thoracic injuries","Accidents; Automotive industry; Ballistics; Biomechanics; Blasting; Concrete bridges; Crashworthiness; Explosives; Fits and tolerances; Laminates; Numerical models; Shear strain; 3D-finite element analysis; Accident reconstruction; Bio-mechanical models; Displacement-time history; Free fall; Mechanical structures; Real world accidents; Thoracic injury; Finite element method",,,20407939,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959502745

One of the most important reasons for this lack of information is that the Turkish archives are not organized in such a way that researchers can easily access documents on ordinary women. However, the difficulty in finding women's voices in historical documents is only one part of the problem. Whereas conventional Ottoman-Turkish historiography prioritizes the acts of those holding power, most Turkish feminist historiography focuses on the organized activities of elite and middle-class women rather than ordinary women due to various paradigmatic and methodological restrictions. This article explains these limitations and proposes less conventional methods for conducting research on ordinary Ottoman women, who were important actors on the home front during World War I. It discusses theoretical approaches, methodology, and alternative sources that can be used to conduct research on women in the Turkish archives. It also presents some examples of ordinary Ottoman women's voices and everyday struggles against the violence they suffered during World War I, using new, alternative sources like women's petitions and telegrams to the state bureaucracy as well as folk songs.","Ordinary women; Ottoman feminism; Ottoman women; Turkish archives; Violence; Women's history; World War I",,,,19332882,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969802475

As fossilized remains of our ancestors provide the only direct evidence for life history evolution, efforts to reconstruct life history in paleontological contexts have focused on hard tissues, particularly on dental development. However, among investigators of other vertebrate groups, there is a long tradition of examining primary bone microstructure to decipher growth rates and maturational timing, based on an empirical relationship between the microanatomy of primary bone and the rate at which it is deposited. We examined ontogenetic variation in primary bone microstructure at the midshaft femur of Chlorocebus aethiops, Hylobates lar, and Pan troglodytes to test whether tissue type proportions vary in accordance with predictions based on body mass growth patterns described previously. In all taxa, younger age classes were characterized by significantly higher percent areas of fibro-lamellar and/or parallel-fibered tissues, while older age classes showed significantly higher proportions of lamellar bone. In prior experimental studies, fibro-lamellar and parallel-fibered tissue types have been associated with faster depositional rates than lamellar bone. Principal components analysis revealed differences among taxa in the timing of this transition, and in the particular tissue types observed among individuals of similar dental emergence status. Among M1 and M2 age classes, higher proportions of parallel-fibered and fibro-lamellar tissues were observed in those taxa characterized by reportedly faster body mass growth rates. Further, persistence of fibro-lamellar tissue throughout DECID, M1 and M2 age classes in chimpanzees contrasts with the pattern reported previously for modern humans. Despite the necessary limitations of our cross-sectional study design and the secondary remodeling of bone in primates, large areas of primary bone remain intact and represent a valuable and independent source of information about the evolution of growth and development in the fossil record. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Apes; Bone histology; Growth and development; Life history; Old World monkeys","bone; histology; human evolution; life history; paleontology; primate; Cercopithecidae; Cercopithecus aethiops; Hylobates lar; Pan; Pan troglodytes; Primates; Vertebrata",,,00472484,,JHEVA,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960158410

Objectives In a major referral hospital in the capital city of Cameroon, we compared in-hospital mortality rates in patients with a WHO-based diagnosis of stroke between participants with and without brain imaging on admission. Methods Stroke patients with and without admission brain imaging were compared for demographic characteristics, risk factors, clinical and laboratory characteristic, and in-hospital mortality. Heterogeneities in mortality rates (CT vs. No CT) across major subgroups were investigated via interaction tests, and logistic regressions used to adjust for extraneous factors such as age, sex, year of study, residency, history of diabetes and hypertension, history of stroke, Glasgow coma scale, and delay between stroke symptoms onset and hospital admission. Results Of the 1688 participants included in the final analysis, 1048 (62.1%) had brain imaging. The median age of the non-CT vs. CT groups was 65 vs. 62 years (p-value < 0.0001%). The death rate of non-CT vs. CT groups was 27.5% vs. 16.4% (p < 0.0001). This difference was mostly similar across major subgroups, and robust to the adjustments for confounders (in spite of substantial attenuation), with excess deaths in those with CT ranging from 65% to 149%. Conclusion In this resource-limited environment, the absence of brain imaging on admission was associated with high in-hospital death from stroke, which was only partially explained by delayed hospitalization with severe disease. These results stressed the importance of scaling up acute stroke management in low- and middle-income countries. © 2016 The Authors.","Cameroon; Computerized tomography; Mortality; Stroke; Sub-Saharan Africa","acetylsalicylic acid; adult; age; aged; anticoagulant therapy; Article; Cameroon; cerebrovascular accident; clinical laboratory; computer assisted tomography; confounding variable; controlled study; demography; diabetes mellitus; fatality; female; Glasgow coma scale; hospital admission; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; medical history; mortality; mortality rate; neuroimaging; priority journal; prognosis; residential area; retrospective study; risk factor; sex; stroke patient; urban population; world health organization",,,24056502,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961603906

It was originally described as a manakin (Pipridae), but molecular work has revealed its closest living relatives to be Old World suboscines (Eurylaimides) and supported its placement in the monotypic family of Sapayoidae. Despite such phylogenetic intrigue, little is known about the Sapayoa's general life history or reproductive biology; only one nest has been described. We present information on 2 actively attended and 13 inactive Sapayoa nests in Darién National Park, Panama. We provide the first detailed description of individual effort at an active nest, family group dynamics during the nesting period, the plumage of immature birds, and the range of vocalizations produced. We also present the first documentation of cooperative breeding and compile several recent nesting observations, extending the published Sapayoa breeding period by several months. Furthermore, we describe unusual behaviors among provisioning birds, including mounting between individuals of the same sex and mounting of a female by immature male helpers during chick provisioning. The receiving individual gave a conspicuous solicitation display before each mounting. Finally, we highlight elements of the Sapayoa's natural history that echo its Old World relatives and contrast with members of the New World Tyranni. For example, the Sapayoa resembles the eurylaimid broadbillsand differs starkly from the manakinsin diet, nest structure, breeding system, and mode of parental care. © 2016 American Ornithologists' Union.","cooperative breeding; helpers; mounting; Old World suboscines; Sapayoa aenigma; Sapayoidae","cooperative breeding; life history; nesting behavior; passerine; phylogenetics; reproductive behavior; reproductive biology; Darien; Ecuador; Panama [Central America]; Pipridae; Sapayoa; Sapayoa aenigma; Tyranni",,,00048038,,AUKJA,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966297102

As it became more and more difficult to study and make claims about non-Western people, anthropologists and scholars in related disciplines began to explore the advantages of treating non-human objects as quasi-human subjects. Things proved safer to study than people and the popularity of ‘thing theory’ grew, at least in part, for this very reason. More importantly, the analytical shift of focus from people to things had the effect of salvaging – and, indeed, greatly amplifying – the representational authority of Western scholars at the precise moment when that authority seemed to be evaporating. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","material culture; postcolonial theory; posthumanism","cultural history; material culture; post-colonialism; twentieth century; Western world",,,13591835,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960879868

Heterologous polyclonal antibodies are obtained from animals hyperimmunised with a pathogen or toxin. Aims: The aims of this review are to examine the history of animal polyclonal antibody therapy use, their development into safe and effective products and the potential application to humans for emerging and neglected infectious diseases. Methods: A literature search of OVID Medline and OVID Embase databases was undertaken to identify articles on the safety, efficacy and ongoing development of polyclonal antibodies. The search contained database-specific MeSH and EMTREE terms in combination with pertinent text-words: polyclonal antibodies and rare/neglected diseases, antivenins, immunoglobulins, serum sickness, anaphylaxis, drug safety, post marketing surveillance, rabies, human influenza, Dengue, West Nile, Nipah, Hendra, Marburg, MERS, Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, and Crimean-Congo. No language limits were applied. The final search was completed on 20.06.2015. Of 1960 articles, title searches excluded many irrelevant articles, yielding 303 articles read in full. Of these, 179 are referenced in this study. Results: Serum therapy was first used in the 1890s against diphtheria. Early preparation techniques yielded products contaminated with reactogenic animal proteins. The introduction of enzymatic digestion, and purification techniques substantially improved their safety profile. The removal of the Fc fragment of antibodies further reduces hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of polyclonal antibodies against various infections, toxins and venoms. Products are being developed against infections for which prophylactic and therapeutic options are currently limited, such as avian influenza, Ebola and other zoonotic viruses. Conclusions: Polyclonal antibodies have been successfully applied to rabies, envenomation and intoxication. Polyclonal production provides an exciting opportunity to revolutionise the prognosis of both longstanding neglected tropical diseases as well as emerging infectious threats to humans. © 2016.","Antitoxin; Antivenin; Arboviruses; Immunotherapy; Influenza","antitoxin; immunoglobulin Fc fragment; polyclonal antibody; venom antiserum; antibody; antitoxin; venom antiserum; allergic reaction; antigen antibody complex; avian influenza (H5N1); bibliographic database; Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever; dengue; drug efficacy; drug safety; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; envenomation; epidemic; heterologous immunity; highly pathogenic avian influenza; human; infection; intoxication; Marburg hemorrhagic fever; nonhuman; pandemic; passive immunization; post exposure prophylaxis; practice guideline; priority journal; rabies; Review; world health organization; anaphylaxis; animal; chemistry; clinical trial (topic); Communicable Diseases; history; Anaphylaxis; Animals; Antibodies; Antitoxins; Antivenins; Clinical Trials as Topic; Communicable Diseases; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis",,,0264410X,,VACCD,26802604,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958036140

Methods: A systematic search was made in the original literature beginning in the Greek period with Homer in ca 800 bc and extending up to Aetios Amidenos in the late Roman period in ca 600 ad. Results: Rough seas and unpleasant odors were recognized as the major triggers; susceptibility was greater in persons not adapted to sea travel, of a labile mental state, or with anxiety; nausea, emesis, vertigo, anorexia, faintness, apathy, headache, and impending doom were frequently reported symptoms. Preventive and therapeutic measures included habituation to sea travel, looking at stationary contrasts on the coast, fasting or certain diets, inhaling pleasant fragrances, medicinal plants, and ingesting a mixture of wine and wormwood. Conclusion: The triggers, symptoms, and preventive measures of seasickness were well-known in antiquity. The implications for transport of troops and military actions were repeatedly described, e.g., by Livius and Caesar. At that time, the pathophysiologic mechanism was explained by the humoral theory of Empedokles and Aristoteles. Seneca Minor localized the bodily symptoms in various organs such as stomach, gullet, and esophagus, and also attributed them to an imbalance of bile. Recommended medication included ingestion of the plant white hellebore, a violent gastrointestinal poison.

This view has, in the last decade, come under attack from historians who have, inter alia, criticised the nature and speed of the medical measures employed by the British. This has focused particularly on the management of the typhus epidemic, erroneously claimed to be the major disease killer of the survivors, and which was the catalyst for the premature German surrender of the camp to the approaching Allies about 3 weeks before the end of the war. This review examines the veracity of this statement and the nature of the evidence on which it was based. Methods Review of all the relevant extant primary source written evidence both published and archived in major collections in London, Washington and Belsen, in addition to the relevant subsequent secondary evidence. Results Disprove the ill-considered and scientifically flawed attempts to discredit the RAMC and demonstrate that the RAMC can be shown to have made the correct prioritising decisions in relieving starvation as well as in implementing the appropriate public health anti-typhus measures and to have acquitted itself honourably.

There is a growing body of literature asserting that women's autonomy is associated with a broad range of health outcomes. Objective: This study examined the relationship between women's autonomy and cervical cancer screening to inform interventions in global cervical cancer care. Methods: A generalized estimating equation approach to logistic regression was used to analyze associations between women's autonomy indicators and both cervical cancer screening knowledge and personal history in a cross sectional sample of 4049 married women in Lesotho. Results: More than half of the women surveyed (65.2%) had never heard of a pap smear, and only 7.2% had ever had one. Women who participated in all types of household decision-making were 1.4 times more likely to have heard of a pap smear (estimated risk ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 1.8) compared to women with lower participation levels (p = 0.032). Conclusions: This study extends earlier research demonstrating that women's autonomy predicts improved health outcomes, to include cervical cancer screening awareness, but not action. This finding, that augmenting women's autonomy improves cervical cancer screening awareness, adds yet another to the myriad reasons for focusing global attention on issues of gender equity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cancer awareness; Cancer screening; Cervical cancer; Health disparities; Lesotho; Women's autonomy","autonomy; cancer; developing world; health survey; womens health; adolescent; adult; Article; cancer screening; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; decision making; demography; female; health survey; household; human; knowledge; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; medical history; middle aged; Papanicolaou test; patient care; personal autonomy; public health service; social participation; uterine cervix cancer; young adult; Lesotho",,,02779536,,SSMDE,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951299759

This is an example of a subject with great sweep (with many interrelated sub-topics over, in this case, a 3,000 year history) that is hard to grasp by any individual and, in its full detail, is not available as a coherent story. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to construct a data driven view of Roman history based on a large collection of Wikipedia articles. Extracting and enabling the discovery of useful knowledge on events, places, times, and their connections from large amounts of textual data has always been a challenging task. To this aim, we introduce VAiRoma, a visual analytics system that couples state-of-the-art text analysis methods with an intuitive visual interface to help users make sense of events, places, times, and more importantly, the relationships between them. VAiRoma goes beyond textual content exploration, as it permits users to compare, make connections, and externalize the findings all within the visual interface. As a result, VAiRoma allows users to learn and create new knowledge regarding Roman history in an informed way. We evaluated VAiRoma with 16 participants through a user study, with the task being to learn about roman piazzas through finding relevant articles and new relationships. Our study results showed that the VAiRoma system enables the participants to find more relevant articles and connections compared to Web searches and literature search conducted in a roman library. Subjective feedback on VAiRoma was also very positive. In addition, we ran two case studies that demonstrate how VAiRoma can be used for deeper analysis, permitting the rapid discovery and analysis of a small number of key documents even when the original collection contains hundreds of thousands of documents. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Electronic publishing; Encyclopedias; History; Internet; Visual analytics","Electronic publishing; History; Interface states; Internet; Visualization; Websites; Encyclopedias; Literature search; Subjective feedback; Text-analysis methods; Visual analytics; Visual analytics systems; Visual Interface; Wikipedia articles; World Wide Web",,,10772626,,ITVGE,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946545993

We did not find associations with allergic disorders such as asthma or with blood pressure or cholesterol, and we noted an increase in tooth decay with longer periods of breastfeeding. For nursing women, breastfeeding gave protection against breast cancer and it improved birth spacing, and it might also protect against ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes.

She argues that the presence of violence is one of the organizing features of Woolf's body of writing, at both thematic and formal levels, and yet, in a quieter, less visible way, that Woolf always countered violence with the possibilities of peace, harmony, and beauty. Elucidating these patterns as they emerge in Woolf's treatments of war and history, the essay gives a view of Woolf as fundamentally motivated by the call to formalize in her writing the effects of war and violence, but also to create alternatives, in mind and in text, to the brutal violence that, as she never forgot, has characterized western history from the beginning. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The research questions are: What type of education did the organisation provide and what values and skills did its members learn? Based on data gathered from a variety of sources, including archives, magazines and previous studies, it appears that boys education in the Civil Guard emphasised Finnish nationalism, Christianity, good manners and various sports skills. Practical training was also provided. During the Second World War, the values and skills learned were put into action – boys participated on the home-front, performing various work assignments that significantly aided the war effort by freeing men for other duties. Some boys participated in military service behind the front line and some voluntarily joined the battlefront troops.

Simons studied these reflexes in hemiplegic patients, who were mainly victims of World War I. This work became his most important contribution and remained unsurpassed for many years. The film (Filmarchiv, Bundesarchiv [Film Archive, National Archive] Berlin) with Simons as an examiner shows 11 war casualties with brain lesions that occurred between 1916 and 1919. The injuries reveal asymmetric neck reflexes with ""Mitbewegungen,"" that is, flexion or extension on the hemiplegic side. Mitbewegungen is identical with Francis Walshes ""associated reactions"" caused by neck rotation and/or by cocontraction of the nonaffected extremities, for example, by closing of the fist (Walshe). The knowledge of the neck reflexes is important in acute neurology and in rehabilitation therapy of hemiplegics for antispastic positions.

The Pharmacovigilance Program of India (PvPI) is playing a major role in gathering drug safety related data and adding it to the WHO database. PvPI fulfills the minimum requirements given by the WHO for any functional national Pharmacovigilance system. The Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) is the national coordinating center under PvPI. PV in India relies mainly upon the spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events. The major challenge for PV in India is under-reporting. However, there is an improvement in the number of submitted reports after regular training and awareness programmes, which have been conducted by the IPC. The regular and periodic circulation of the PvPI Newsletter by the IPC has also been instrumental in increasing awareness about PV amongst healthcare professionals and patients. The intensification of PV activities in India demands particular attention in health science curricula.

However, robust investigations attempting to decipher the clinical nature of phobias emerged in pre-modern times during the oft-overlooked Islamic Golden Era (9th-12th centuries); which overlapped with Europe's medieval period. An innovative attempt was made by the 9th century Muslim scholar, Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, in his medical manuscript ""Sustenance of the Body and Soul,"" to define phobias as a separate diagnostic entity. Al-Balkhi was one of the earliest to cluster psychological and physical symptoms of phobias under one category, ""al-Fazaá"", and outline a specific management plan.

Chargaff was born in Chernivtsi (Austria-Hungary, now Ukraine) but during the First World War his family was forced to move to Vienna. After graduating from the University of Vienna, Chargaff worked in Berlin, where he studied bacterial lipids. Due to Nazis coming to power in Germany, Chargaff moved to Paris and later (1935) emigrated to the USA and obtained a position at Columbia University, where he initially investigated the role of phospholipids in blood clotting. In 1944, applying novel methods Chargaff initiated intensive investigation of the chemical composition of nucleic acids from taxonomically distant species and established two rules which were later named after him. The first Chargaff's rule provided a significant support to Watson and Crick in construction of their double helical DNA model. The explosion of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced Chargaff to think about the moral responsibility of researchers and science to mankind. He begins to raise these issues in the press and manifests himself as a talented journalist, who criticized the bureaucratization of science and its transformation into a way of earning money. Despite decades of life in America, spiritually Erwin Chargaff always remained a European, who never forgot his roots and always remembered his native land.",,"Europe; history; molecular biology; morality; research ethics; United States; war; Ethics, Research; Europe; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Molecular Biology; Moral Obligations; United States; World War I; World War II",,,05643783,,,27266188,"Ukrainian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975749019

One medical writer who exemplifies this change is Soranus of Ephesus (c. 98-138 AD). In his Gynecology, there are a number of passages where compassion is addressed or expressed (such as the chapters on the qualities of the best midwife, the symptom of pica, childbirth, and superstition). The same points can be made of Soranus' On Chronic Diseases, preserved to some extent by the Latin version and adaptation by fifth century AD medical writer Caelius Aurelianus (see, for example, the chapters on chronic headache, mania and elephantiasis). Soranus and Caelius display compassion, understanding, and flexibility of approach when dealing with patient issues; they show themselves willing to change their medical technique when they see that it is doing more harm or discomfort than good.

In 1957, the proportion of former NSDAP members among East German university professors of paediatrics was 100 per cent. When it came to new appointments, both members of the.bourgeois"" academic non-professorial teaching staff from the GDR as well as paediatricians from West Germany, who had largely gained their scientifically qualifications under National Socialism, were in the running. A politically-controlled elite exchange did not take place until the construction of the Wall. State and party organs generally followed the personnel proposals of the universities since an insufficient number of qualified candidates was available for the systematic appointment of "" progressive"" paediatricians. Given the lack of staff, the SED personnel policy was aimed at the integration of previous elites, as long as they behaved loyally towards the new state. Since the East German faculties continued to make the questioning of the professionally competent professors in West Germany and East Germany the basis for their appointment lists, West German university paediatricians were able to exert considerable influence on the appointment of East German paediatric professorships until the 1960s.","Appointment process; Denazification; East Germany; GDR; History of paediatrics; Soviet occupation zone; University policy","communism; German Democratic Republic; history; medical school; national socialism; pediatrics; war; Communism; Faculty, Medical; Germany, East; History, 20th Century; National Socialism; Pediatrics; World War II",,,00258431,,,27476257,"German",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981248742

The inscription presents an ideal case for a truly interdisciplinary study of the patient-history, in that its interpretation involves the study of Greek literature and linguistics, epigraphy, social and religious history, and ancient medicine. It also offers ample opportunity to show the contradictions inherent in proposing retrospective diagnosis, without neglecting the relevant information modern medicine has to offer for the interpretation of this case history. We argue that Lucius' father was most probably a physician, that the text of the inscription stems from expert knowledge of ancient medicine and that the traditional retrospective diagnosis of this case, tuberculosis, is an untenable hypothesis.",,"cultural anthropology; history; literature; patient; psychology; public figure; Biography as Topic; Famous Persons; Greek World; History, Ancient; Patients",,,09251421,,,26946673,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964695224

Touch is an essential aspect of the ancient doctor's art, but one potentially fraught with concerns over gender: while seeing, hearing, and smelling are also central to the medical encounter, touching is the act that places the greatest demands on the privacy and bodily integrity of the patient. This paper shows--perhaps counterintuitively--that, despite the multiple assertions of gender differences put forward by the authors of the Hippocratic Corpus, these authors make little distinction between touching male and female patients. At the same time, the paper argues that ancient physicians were anxious to avoid the charge that they were harming their patients when they touched them. It demonstrates that male doctors, sensitive as they were to the problems posed by their interactions with female patients, were challenged in different ways when engaging in intimate contact with male patients.",,"alternative medicine; cultural anthropology; doctor patient relation; female; history; human; male; patient; psychology; publication; Female; Greek World; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Manuscripts, Medical; Patients; Physician-Patient Relations; Therapeutic Touch",,,09251421,,,26946680,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964694826

This chapter examines these 'voice pathologies' and evaluatestheir impact on the dialogue between patients and Hippocratic physicians. In short, Hippocratic authors treat patients' voices in two dissonant ways. On the one hand, physicians promote some form of discourse,implicitly relying on patients to report internal sensations resulting fromillnesses. On the other hand, they develop extensive techniques to diminish and downplay this reliance. As a result, Hippocratic authors treatpatients' mouths not so much as the loci of potential subjective expression, but as orifices secreting verbal discharges. They weaken the distinction between the (sonic) effluvia of the mouth and those of other bodilyoutlets, thus bringing verbal output into close conceptual proximity withother types of discharge. Words come to be scrutinised for their quantity,quality and consistency as though they were quasi-excreta of the mouth. (see text).

This study looks at the Hieroi Logoi as an illness narrative and argues against such a simplistic view and in favour of a more complex picture: Aristides is a far cry far from the submissive patient, who idly resided in the Pergamene Asclepieion relying exclusively on the therapeutic powers of the god and his human helpers. In fact, through a close reading of a selection of passages from the Hieroi Logoi a whole new image of Aristides emerges: the informed patient who is not only in possession of the basics of the medical discourse but who also functions as a physician of sorts, taking both his own life and the lives of others into his hands. This new type of patient, the knowledgeable patient, who is well-versed in medical matters and envisages himself as an active agent of the healing process and an equally important partner in the medical encounter, ties well with other testimonies we have about knowledgeable patients mostly to be found amongst the members of the socio-political elite of the time.",,"cultural anthropology; fitness; history; mental health; patient; physician; psychology; publication; Greek World; History, Ancient; Manuscripts, Medical; Mental Health; Patients; Physical Fitness; Physicians",,,09251421,,,26946690,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964694473

What remains elusive and hidden is the viewpoint of the patient and his personal experience within, or under the authoritative report compiled by the physician. In this chapter, I survey key stylistic features of these reports, which I see as significant to the reconstruction of the point of view of the ill in his or her encounter with the doctor. My main aim is to extract from these texts as much as possible information about the experience of suffering and patienthood in antiquity.

It examines how films and their motifs and characters from the early 1920s until the early 1930s evoked and revived historical events seen as extremely valuable by a society that had lived through them. Outlined first is how the popular image of the First World War Italian warrior (i.e. the ""Milite Ignoto"" or ""Unknown Soldier"") was constructed. Second, the article chronicles how this image became a subject for film, and how that choice affected the themes of Italian cinematographic production, notably non-fictional, in the period spanning from the First World War's end until the ascent of Fascism and its affermath. The role of full-length Gloria. Apoteosi del soldato ingot (Glory. Apotheosis of the Unknown Soldier), Federazione Cinematografica Italiana / Unione Fototecnici Cinematografici, 1921) was a prominent one for it showed how the image of the unknown soldier began to acquire the dimension of a myth. Some fragments of its footage for example-where the tomb of the Milite Ignoto (at the Altare della Patria at Vittoriano) was filmed-served in the making of the film Gloria (Glory) by Roberto Omegna in 1934 which was later distributed by the Fascists' Educational Film Union-LUCE. The article thus details how Italians' postwar image of the unknown soldier changed due to the Fascists' manipulation of memory.","First world war; History of Italian cinema; History of Italian Fascism; Memory studies; Unknown soldier",,,,22199659,,,,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992110971

Galen sets himself the task of developing a system of proper or literal (kyrios) terms for pain sensations, even despite the apparent ineffability of certain sensations and laymen's imprecise self-analysis and description of their suffering.

For each skeleton, extraction using only 0.05 g of powder was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (no demineralisation - ND method). Since only 32% of full profiles were obtained from aged and 58% from contemporary casework skeletons, the extraction protocol was modified to acquire higher quality DNA and genomic DNA was obtained after full demineralisation (FD method). The nuclear DNA of the samples was quantified using the Investigator Quantiplex kit and STR typing was performed using the NGM kit to evaluate the performance of tested extraction methods. In the aged DNA samples, 64% of full profiles were obtained using the FD method. For the contemporary skeletal remains the performance of the ND method was closer to the FD method compared to the old skeletons, giving 58% of full profiles with the ND method and 71% of full profiles using the FD method. The extraction of DNA from only 0.05 g of bone or tooth powder using the AutoMate Express has proven highly successful in the recovery of DNA from old and contemporary skeletons, especially with the modified FD method. We believe that the results obtained will contribute to the possibilities of using automated devices for extracting DNA from skeletal remains, which would shorten the procedures for obtaining high-quality DNA from skeletons in forensic laboratories. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Such injuries can result in the removal of the individual from combat, thus eliminating any subsequent contribution that he or she might have made to the battle. However, at times, the injuries can have more wide-reaching effects. In the case of commanders or leaders, the impact of their injuries may include the loss of their influence, planning, and leadership, and thus have a disproportionate effect on the battle, or indeed the war. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was a talented military strategist and leader who was respected by friends and foes alike. He held an honored reputation by the German people and the military leadership. His head injury on July 17, 1944, resulted in his being removed from the field of battle in northern France, but also meant that he was not able to lend his stature to the assassination attempt of Adolph Hitler on July 20. It is possible that, had he been able to lend his stature to the events, Hitler's hold on the nation's government might have been loosened, and the war might have been brought to an end a year earlier.

We used Monte-Sano and Budano's (2012) framework for pedagogical content knowledge for teaching history to examine the teacher's planning over the course of a year. Through interviews and analysis of artifacts, we found more specific sub-categories that represent the various ways that the teacher thought about transforming, representing, framing, and attending to students' ideas about world history. Additionally, we found a hierarchical relationship in the aspects of the teacher's pedagogical content knowledge that aligned with her phases of planning (skeletal, unit planning, reflective) throughout the year. These findings highlight content-specific issues in planning world history courses-particularly those focused on the earliest eras-including questions about how teachers can find appropriate resources, organize world history content for teaching, and help students understand world historical narratives.

His preference here for authorities such as Thracians and Scythians rather than illustrious ones, along with his 'language of the nursery', points to an oral, rather than literary, tradition. Soranus seems to have been the first to write so extensively on childcare; freed from the influence of any earlier tradition, he engaged in a more nuanced vision of childhood, seeing it as a 'blank slate' both physically and mentally, untouched by the faults of adulthood.

The paper explores the professional lives of two women, the medical researcher, Elsie Dalyell, and the teacher, feminist and unionist, Lucy Woodcock. The paper examines their professional lives and acquisition and use of university expertise both on the war and home fronts, and shows how women’s intellectual and scientific activity established during the war continued long after as a way to repair what many believed to be a society damaged by war. It argues that the idea of “knowledge front” reveals a continuity of intellectual and scientific activity from war to peace, and offers “space” to examine the professional lives of university-educated women in this period. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is structured as an analytical narrative interweaving the professional lives of two women, medical researcher Elsie Dalyell and teacher/unionist Lucy Woodcock to illuminate the contributions of university-educated women’s expertise from 1914 to the outbreak of the Second World War. Findings: The emergence of university-educated women in the First World War and the interwar years participated in the civic structure of Australian society in innovative and important ways that challenged the “soldier citizen” ethos of this era. The paper offers a way to examine university-educated women’s professional lives as they unfolded during the course of war and peace that focuses on what they did with their expertise. Thus, the “knowledge front” provides more ways to examine these lives than the more narrowly articulated ideas of “home” and “war” front. Research limitations/implications: The idea of the “knowledge front” applied to women in this paper also has implications for how to analyse the meaning of the First World War-focused university expertise more generally both during war and peace. Practical implications: The usual view of women’s participation in war is as nurses in field hospitals. This paper broadens the notion of war to see war as having many interconnected fronts including the battle front and home front (Beaumont, 2013). By doing so, not only can we see a much larger involvement of women in the war, but we also see the involvement of university-educated women. Social implications: The paper shows that while the guns may have ceased on 11 November 1918, women’s lives continued as they grappled with their war experience and aimed to reassert their professional lives in Australian society in the 1920s and 1930s. Originality/value: The paper contains original biographical research of the lives of two women.

Methods: A prospective study was conducted over a period of 6 mo in the medicine department of Bharati Hospital and Research Centre, Pune. HTN and (HTN with DM patients. Who met the study criteria were enrolled in the study. The pattern of antihypertensive medications prescribed was studied and analyzed using Microsoft excel 2010 and Statistical. The rational prescribing pattern was assessed by using JNC 7 guidelines and World Health Organization (WHO) indicators. Results: Total of 60 patients included in this study, 43 (71.7 %) were HTN patients, and 17 (28.3 %) were HTN with DM patients. There were 29 (48.33 %) males and 31 (51.66 %) female patients were involved. 45 % of patients had pre-hypertension, 33.33 % had stage-1 hypertension, 8.4 % had stage-2 hypertension other 13.33 % patients are on Antihypertensive medications and whose Blood Pressure (BP) were normal according to JNC-7. In hypertensive 47.05 % patient had prescribed Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) as monotherapy along with 87.5 % Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) with diuretics as combination therapy. In HTN with DM 46.15 % patients had prescribed Angiotensin Converting Enzymes (ACEs) as monotherapy along with 62.5 % CCBs with BBs were prescribed according to JNC-7. As per WHO indicators, average no. of medicines prescribed per prescription was 2.91 and all antihypertensive medicines in the study population were prescribed rationally.

In doing so, it briefly examines how history and war are represented in mainstream videogames and, subsequently, how these dominant frames of representation are challenged and refashioned within the emerging genre of historical serious games. Regarding the latter, this article focuses on a case study of Czechoslovakia 38-89: Assassination, a serious game on contemporary history, which we developed in 2015 at Charles University and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. It specifically examines how the Czech historical memory of World War II is presented via the game and it critically discusses design challenges stemming from adapting real persons' - oftentimes ethically-and emotionally-loaded - testimonies in order to construct in-game narratives. In particular, the article discusses the intersections and tensions between authenticity and fiction, realism and schematization, and narrative and procedure. Finally, the article critically investigates the perception and acceptance of Czechoslovakia 38-89: Assassination by Czech teachers and students, as well as the general public in the Czech Republic. To this end, it analyzes how the game's meaning potential is disseminated to and negotiated by concrete audiences in different contexts of reception. © 2001-2016 Game Studies.","Czechoslovakia 38-89: Assassination; History; Memory; Realism; Representation; Serious games; World War II",,,,16047982,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010955736

Classical philosophies of history (Turgot, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Humboldt) aim at understanding their own time as history: i. e., they do not only think of a meaning, nor do they only conceive of themselves as a concluding theoretical apprehension at the end of a process. They also endeavor to envisage the process itself, the forces of change, the phenomena of these forces, and the moral issues raised by them. Lowith's three-ages model can be a frame for a philosophy of classical philosophies of history. The different divisions of world history into epochs made by them show what categories are deemed significant in order to conceptualize mankind as one subject through time. Lowith's idea of nature seems to be at odds with the idea of nature set forth by an author whose importance he emphasizes, namely Charles Darwin: Darwin always conceives nature within time. However, Lowith's skeptical back-to-nature line of thinking, against the pervasiveness of history and progress in the West, must be viewed within his critical appraisal of Heidegger. His meditations about the diversity and the unity of men are still very significant today.

This includes believing in the haldjad, or Little People. This ethnographic study demonstrates that many traditional beliefs with pre-Christian elements continue to be a way of living, even in modern America. The subject was born in Estonia during World War II, and later lived as a refugee in one of the American-run camps with her mother and three siblings from August 1945 to May 1950. Even though she was very young when she left Estonia, she inherited the traditional beliefs of her ancestors through her mother, beliefs that sustained her through the harsh dis­placed persons’ camps and on to America. Her belief system includes the haldjad, whom she sees as her guardians and guides, who often manifest themselves as the Little People. Believing in the Little People is interwoven with the traditional Estonian belief system that everything is alive and sentient. She discusses the major differences in life philosophies between the conquering Germans and the Estonians, mainly how the German invaders emphasized domination over the land, as opposed to the Estonian peasants who worked with the land. She sees her worldview as being universal, especially in indigenous cultures, saying: “What we call the old religion is not a religion at all.

These households, often under direction of a widow, and to a lesser extent, of a spinster or an unhappily married woman, are providing historians with the possibility to observe women's lives from the margins of structures of patriarchal power. The economic, social and affective reality of unhappily married women needs a profound analysis, that goes beyond a quantitative magnitude, facing the challenge of imagining these women in conditions that, at first glance, didn't go beyond exceptional and accidental, but in reality they could have formed an environment of autonomy and power for themselves.

It has been viewed mostly as a stage reached as a result of long-term societal changes over the course of world history. For us, globalization has been an ongoing process for at least the last 5000 years. Little attention has been paid to the socioeconomic and natural processes that led to the current transformation. With the exception of historical sociologists, there is less interest in examining the long-term past as it is often assumed that the past has nothing to teach us, and it is the future that we have to turn our intellectual gaze. This paper will argue the opposite. We believe a long-term tracing of the socioeconomic and political processes of the making of the modern world will allow us to have a more incisive understanding of the current trajectory of world development and transformations. To plead our case, we outline the emergence of the first Eurasian World Economy linking seven regions (Europe, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, the Persian Gulf, Central Asia, South Asia, Ceylon, Southeast Asia, and China) of the world, with the exception of the Americas, starting as early as 200 BC, and the sequence of structural crises and transformations (trading networks and commodities) that has circumscribed the structures and trends of the current global system. Such consideration in our view is limited if we do not also include the relations between social systems and Nature, and the rhythms of the climate. For the latter, an awareness of the natural rhythms of the climate as well as human induced changes or climate forcing have triggered system-wide level collapses during certain early historical periods. © 2016 by the authors.","Globalization; Social change; Social system crisis","climate change; culture; globalization; nature-society relations; political process; social change; social history; socioeconomic conditions; World",,,20711050,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956657035

We’ll try, in this text, to discuss the performance of the school, the teacher, and the didactic materials while teaching tools that aim to combat hate manifestations present both in State’s structure, and in society. Nowadays there is a growing call for evaluation of what we have been learning and teaching about traumatic events. Especially in Brazilian education, the teaching about collective trauma is treated mostly as a footnote in overarching themes, like the Holocaust in relation to World War II. It’s clear that curriculums and pedagogical instruments available in Brazil don’t give the necessary support for the agents of the educational process. In this way, we aim to show and problematize YadVashem’s didactical materials, the museum responsible for Holocaust Memory, and the manner that the theme has been explored in Israel, its methods and objectives.

The exploration of original texts from the period in question and a critical discourse analysis provides a chronological narrative of events.

The paper starts with a brief sketch of the history of the field. When compared to earlier approaches, current thinking about 'communication, innovation and development' pays greater attention to limitations in the potential of orchestrating change and innovation in pre-planned directions, and to political and institutional dimensions of both communication and innovation. In relation to this, new lines of questioning are discussed. The article ends with a reflection on the usefulness of the thinking from different historical periods today.

For the linked open data to benefit from the potential represented by this huge amount of data, it is crucial to come up with solutions to expose heterogeneous databases as linked data. The xR2RML mapping language is an endeavor towards this goal: it is designed to map various types of databases to RDF, by flexibly adapting to heterogeneous query languages and data models while remaining free from any specific language. It extends R2RML, the W3C recommendation for the mapping of relational databases to RDF, and relies on RML for the handling of various data formats. In this paper we present xR2RML, we analyse data models of several modern databases as well as the format in which query results are returned, and we show how xR2RML translates any result data element into RDF, relying on existing languages such as XPath and JSONPath when necessary. We illustrate some features of xR2RML such as the generation of RDF collections and containers, and the ability to deal with mixed data formats.

The article provides an overview of WWI games, organising them by genre and determining their engagement with the imagery that typically sustains and constitutes WWI popular memory. This reveals that -- unusually for popular history -- the majority of these games (40/58) do not significantly engage this memory. The article attempts to explain this lack of engagement by examining the issues that face videogames in trying to engage WWI popular memory (tonal incompatibility; fear of trivialisation through ludification; uncertainty about playable positions) given its relatively sensitive and contested nature. Accordingly, the analysis suggests that the nature of the depictions of WWI that players are exposed to in this new popular form is partly shaped by the particular limitations that the videogame form and its perceived cultural role entail. In doing so, the article also examines the nature of the videogame as a form for historical representation. © 2001-2016 Game Studies.","Collective memory; Frame analysis; Games; Historical games; History; Popular memory; World War I",,,,16047982,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010966925

Azevedo composed a large quantity of Latin verse during these unhappy years, from a four-book epic poem on the return of the Jesuits expelled from the American colonies to a twelve-book description of the city of Venice. The main focus here is Azevedo's collection of Latin verse epistles, Epistolae ad heroas (Venice, 1781), loosely modeled on Ovid.

The period was problematic on account of the difficult economic situation and changes in the political system. On one hand the hospital suffered relatively large damage due to bombing attacks during the war and on the other it had to face numerous staffing problems, especially with a lack of physicians and trained nursing staff (from 1948 an executive order entered into force forbidding the nursing nuns from performing nursing care in hospitals). The change in the political system required the management of the hospital to be taken over by an individual who enjoyed the political, professional and economic trust of the then authorities. Based on his engagement during the Second World War, the director, Zmago Slokan, represented a form of guarantee for the political system of that time, which nevertheless wanted the quality-based, professional and economic progress of the hospital. Using his personal characteristics, professional medical and economic knowledge as well as political experience, he was able to manage different tendencies to continue the quality-based progress of the institution. Thus, he set a proper foundation for its development in the periods that followed, in the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia as well as in the independent Republic of Slovenia (after 1991). The author discusses the role of the director in the hospital’s progress chronologically.

The first literary narratives, which were all dedicated to the Slovene readers, were mostly written by authors from Slovenia, having an ideological impact and clear distinctions of the characters (I. Ribič). In the 1970s and 1980s were published several Slovene novels from Carinthian and Slovene authors (M. Turnšek, V. Habjan, V. Polanšek) which ground, already like the first narratives, on chronicle, biographical or autobiographical elements and have the explicit intention to keep alive the memory on the partisan struggle, the protagonists, and the victims of the Nazi terror. They all refer to different oral and textual sources, to historical persons and occurrences, and prefer a third person narrative perspective. Only after 2000, when a number of witness and memory literature was already published, new novels and dramas with Carinthian Slovene war topics issued (F. Lipuš, F. Skuk, K. Vennemann, P. Handke, M. Haderlap; T. Leisch, B. Liepold-Mosser), recently even on WW I (J. Ferk, E. Messner). Most of them are written in German and represent new narrative modes and models, as they refer or relate to the intimate witness and memory literature of Carinthian Slovenes, historical sources and memory discourses, representing in first or third person respectively autobiographical tales different voices and perspectives on wartime, traumas, and post-war experiences, as well as their influence on the descendants. Many of these narratives are not only highly discursive but also take part in the still conflictive discourses in Carinthia about the partisan resistance and memory culture.","Carinthia; Intertextuality; Literary genres; Literature and history; Memory discourse; Novel; Slovenian literature; War narratives; World War I; World War II",,,,03511189,,,,"Slovenian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988812033

'The Myth of Sao Hai' depicts the sacrifice for the 'nation' of a female spirit inhabiting a millennial tree in a remote part of the jungle. The contention in this paper is that the myth, as re-narrated by Daen-arun, reveals the problematic conditions under which peripheral voices are constantly relegated to a subaltern position in relation to the centre. These are the same conditions under which Thailand's local history has been written: that is to say, under and through a hegemonic 'royalist-nationalist' history. However, through an analysis of 'ironic fissure' - that is, of dissident voices which disrupt the narrative homogeneity - the paper argues that the relationship between the national and the local is not mirrored in a fixed binary opposition of oppression and subordination. Rather, the relationship is marked by ambivalence, an ambivalence that is crucial to the possibility of the writing and the 'narration' of both.","Daen-arun seangthong; Local history; Myth; Royalist-nationalist history; Thai historiography; World literature","historical perspective; literature review; nationalism; Thailand",,,0967828X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957864696

(Thinking about Christa T.) (1968). All three novels share a common preoccupation with the processes of identity construction of the female protagonists, set against the backdrop of the historical events of World War II, the post-war reality of communist ideology and the socialist system, as well as similarities on the plot and narrative level. Literary texts featuring female protagonists in the chronotope of World War I and II not only depict monumental historical events, but also single out women as active participants in these events, while thematising and problematizing traditional gender roles. They challenge old dichotomies of public versus private, subject versus object of history, and definitions of femininity and masculinity, and assert that no sharp dividing lines exist between them. Women in the selected works become active witnesses of historical events, recounting them from direct experience. Their experience, however, is different from that of men. The novels engage in a dialogue with history on both the narrative and story/thematic level. They create a polyphony of narrative voices, a multiperspectivity and a technique of remembering. By employing these techniques, writers endeavour to prevent history and those who have lived it from being forgotten. The protagonists are embedded in a historical moment that allows them to experience a new identity, yet this selfsame historical moment can at the same time also limit them significantly.","Christa; German literature; Identity; Krese; Literary characters; Literature and history; Maruša; Nedeljka; Pirjevec; Slovenian literature; Wolf; Women; World War II",,,,03511189,,,,"Slovenian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988882463

Material and methods A prospective study was conducted on a population cohort composed of 2048 individuals between 30 and 74 years of age with no diabetes. At the start of the study, an epidemiological survey was performed, and baseline glycaemia, HbA1c, body mass index and waist circumference were measured. A follow-up of 6.4 years was conducted. New cases of type 2 diabetes were identified using the electronic primary care medical history. Results The incidence of type 2 diabetes was 3.5 cases/1000 person-years. In the multivariate analysis, the variables that were associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes were age, family history of diabetes, baseline glycaemia (100-125 mg/dL), HbA1c (5.7-6.4%) and waist circumference (≥ 94 cm for men and ≥ 80 cm for women). Of these, the most significantly associated variables were baseline glycaemia and HbA1c. The ADA and WHO criteria for defining prediabetes had the same predictive capacity. Conclusion The incidence of type 2 diabetes measured in Madrid was lower than that found in other population studies, with the glucometabolic state the main factor associated with progression to type 2 diabetes.

This kind of readers' response is being repeated with each new translation into another language, and the Slovenian reception is no exception to the rule. After a brief delineation od foreign and Slovenian reception I treat a few innovations of the novel that are used in representations of the holocaust in an attempt to include them into affirmative outline of the work. One of the key characteristics is the perspective of the first person narrator, who is a Nazi criminal and not a victim; although this perspective is not a complete novelty in literature it is certaintly being very radically used and has brought filmic vividness into descriptions of terrible crimes and also the administrative backgrounds of the massive extermination of the Jews. Already the incipit of Chapter 1 (Toccata) is an apostrophe to the reader that contains at the same time an allusion to Villon (also to Baudelaire and Céline), and the core of the relationship between fiction and history preserved throughout the novel: the controversial subjective I, who is not only an infamous criminal, doctor in law, a cultivated musical and literary connoisseur, but also a victim (he loses his father at an early age, is a homosexual in the SS, a wounded soldier on the eastern front, a victim of severe air bombings in Berlin), and on the other hand an intention to tell «how it all happened» (wie es wirklich geschehen) alluding to the representation of historical events. But despite the huge amount of documentary material the connections of the novel with history are not unambiguous, since it contains many entirely fictional elements (e.g. protagonist's hallucinations, his grotesque encounter with Hitler, rich inter textuallity including the underlying mithological framework of Oresteia in the background) that may come as a disappointment to the readers, who expect to find predominantly historical motivations and descriptions. The Kindly Ones is therefore not a «classical» historical novel writen in a realist manner. It is not even an «ordinary» war novel or just a fictional autobiography and neither is it a dime novel. Because of its rich intertextuallity, mise en abyme, and high degree of fictional self-reflexivity it can be, in accordance with Grethlein, more appropriately labelled as historiographic metafiction.","French literature; Historical novel; Historiographic metafiction; Holocaust; Jonathan; Literature and history; Littell; War novel; World War II",,,,03511189,,,,"Slovenian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988850826

As it became increasingly clear that low-and middle-income countries have a disproportionate share of these disorders, and that many of the problems are best addressed by indigenous researchers who can seek context-sensitive solutions, the US National Institutes of Health and other research funders began to invest more in low-and middle-income country-focused research and research capacity-building to confront this significant public health challenge. In an effort to identify existing information, knowledge gaps, and emerging research and research capacity-building opportunities that are particularly relevant to low-and middle-income countries, in February 2014 the Center for Global Health Studies at the National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center held a workshop to explore these issues with scientific experts from low-and middle-income countries and the United States.

As such, adults in resource-limited settings who may have experienced early deprivation are particularly vulnerable to subsequent neurological disorders. Adult populations in countries with relatively recent advances in economic development may still have a higher susceptibility to neurological illness or injury that is reflective of the socioeconomic environment that was present during that population's infancy and childhood. Brain and peripheral nervous system research conducted over the past decade in resource-limited settings has led to an impressive and growing body of knowledge that informs our understanding of neurological function and dysfunction, independent of geography.

Despite their marked long-term and large-scale impacts on global marine infrastructure, shipping and economies, shipworms, pillbugs and gribbles-collectively referred to as marine woodborers-have received no substantial scholarly attention from environmental historians. This article first overviews their historical spread around the world, demonstrating, too, their disruption of global travel and trade, then traces past problems and management attempts in New Zealand from the arrival of the first humans, c.1300, to the 1930s. New Zealand presents a particularly rich study demonstrating the spread, impacts and management responses to marine woodborers. Until the more widespread and successful use from the 1900s of both ferro-concrete pilings and chromated copper arsenate (CCA) as a wood preservative, colonists in different parts of New Zealand unknowingly experimented with techniques which had failed elsewhere in the country. A longstanding inability to learn from past failures in nineteenth-century New Zealand demonstrates the lack of co-ordinated application of management techniques in the colony, and suggests both the fragmentation of colonial knowledge and the limitations of colonial science, as new ideas were introduced at a local level rather than nationally. Due to the overwhelming attention given to globalisation’s role in spreading terrestrial plants and animals-and to a lesser extent aquatic freshwater fishes-an examination of the extent and response to marine woodborers provides significant new perspectives on the neglected subject of non-indigenous marine organisms. © 2015 The White Horse Press.","Global history; Imperial history; Introduced organisms; Marine environmental history; World history","aquatic organism; bivalve; colonial organism; concrete; environmental history; environmental impact assessment; geographical distribution; globalization; introduced species; isopod; long-term change; management practice; marine environment; nineteenth century; New Zealand; Animalia; Oniscidea; Pisces; Teredinidae",,,09673407,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944726805

Common symptoms of PD include a reduction in control of voluntary movements, rigidity, and tremors. Such symptoms are marked by a severe deterioration in motor function. The causes of PD in many cases are unknown. PD has been found to be prominent in several notable people, including Adolf Hitler, the Chancellor of Germany and Führer of Nazi Germany during World War II. It is believed that Adolf Hitler suffered from idiopathic PD throughout his life. However, the effect of PD on Adolf Hitler's decision making during World War II is largely unknown. Here we examine the potential role of PD in shaping Hitler's personality and influencing his decision-making. We purport that Germany's defeat in World War II was influenced by Hitler's questionable and risky decision-making and his inhumane and callous personality, both of which were likely affected by his condition. Likewise his paranoid disorder marked by intense anti-Semitic beliefs influenced his treatment of Jews and other non-Germanic peoples.

The means to achieve this, according to this first neoliberalism, was by implementing what, in 1978, M. Foucault called ""governmentality"": a multiscalar political system based on the submission of territories to the transnational discipline of a multilateral free division of labour. This thinking was very similar to the convictions of a number of political leaders who, from the 1940s onwards, were involved in creating a new international order uniting Western Europe and the United States, the foundations of which had many similarities with the principles of the first neoliberalism. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Geohistory; Geopolitics; Internationalism; Neoliberalism(s)","ethics; geopolitics; neoliberalism; new world order; political geography; political history",,,09626298,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946606998

By so doing, it set in motion a central dilemma for the discipline of the history of political thought, namely, whether or not there is a necessary rather than a contingent relationship between the need to study political thought and practice historically, in order to speak meaningfully about political ideas and activity in the present. In order to illustrate this, my discussion takes as a starting point some recent accounts of the Great War, during the years of its centennial, in order to show the ways in which political thought and intellectual history seem inextricably intertwined. It then moves back to the nineteenth century, and then forward to contemporary debates about global intellectual history and the history of political thought, suggesting that the primacy of politics is ultimately what differentiates the history of political thought from a potentially more eclectic field of intellectual history. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

For this reason, the 14C dating of mortars is used with increasing frequencies in archaeological and architectural research. Mortars, however, may also contain carbonaceous contaminants potentially affecting radiocarbon dating. The Centre for Isotopic Research on Cultural and Environmental heritage (CIRCE) of the Second University of Naples (SUN) has recently obtained some promising results in mortar radiocarbon dating thanks to the development of a procedure (i.e. CryoSoniC/Cryo2SoniC) aiming to eliminate exogenous C contamination that may occur in a mortar. The construction history of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Modena (Italy) is still controversial and represents a challenging case study for the application of absolute dating methodologies for different reasons. From the point of view of 14C dating, for example, given the high percentage of carbonate aggregates composing these samples, Modena mortars represent an experimental test particularly indicative of exogenous carbon sources suppression ensuring methodology accuracy. In this paper several AMS Radiocarbon dates were carried out on lime lumps with the aim to: (i) verify procedure accuracy by a comparison of the results obtainable from lime lumps dated after different treatments (i.e. bulk lime lumps vs. CryoSoniC purified lime lumps); (ii) compare different building phases absolute chronology for the medieval UNESCO site of Modena, with that assumed by historical sources in order to assess preliminary the 14C dating feasibility for of the site. Historical temporal constraints and mortar clustering, based on petrography, have been applied to define a temporal framework of the analyzed structure. Moreover, a detailed petrographic characterization of mortars was used both as a preliminary tool for the choice of samples and to infer about the lack of accuracy (when verified) of the applied mortar 14C dating procedure. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When modeling SC-SPSWs numerically, these studies considered an idealized tension-only steel plate shear wall (SPSW) web plate behavior. Research has shown that web plate behavior is more complex than predicted by the idealized model, and web plates can provide more strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation than predicted by the idealized model. The idealized model of web plate behavior is used widely in SPSW numerical models where the moment-resisting boundary frame provides supplemental hysteretic damping and stiffness; however, in SC-SPSWs, where the post-tensioned boundary frame is designed to remain elastic during an earthquake, accounting for the more complex web plate behavior can have a significant impact on seismic performance estimates from numerical simulation. This paper presents different methods for modeling SC-SPSWs. Responses from these models are compared with experimental results. A simple modification of the tension-only model, referred to as the tension-compression strip model, is shown to provide a reasonable approximation of SC-SPSW behavior. Results from nonlinear response history analyses of SC-SPSWs with the tension-only and tension-compression web plate models are compared to assess how the approximation of web plate behavior affects SC-SPSW seismic performance. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Self-centering; Shear wall; Shell model; Steel plate; Strip model","Behavioral research; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Geophysics; Numerical models; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear walls; Social networking (online); Stiffness; Nonlinear response history analysis; Self centering; Shell models; Simple modifications; Steel plate shear walls; Steel plates; Strip model; Tension compressions; World Wide Web; comparative study; damping; numerical model; seismic response; shear; steel structure; stiffness; wall",,,00988847,,IJEEB,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941134672

Three-hundred ninety Ghanaian women attending cervical cancer screening were surveyed about their SRHR. The data were analyzed with chi-squared test (p ≤ 0.05, two-sided).Results: 22.1% had a life-time history of non-consensual sexual experience and 55.4% a previous history of abortion, mostly using services of a registered clinic (68.5%). Experience of sexual violence increased life-time risk of abortion (p = 0.018). The overall use of contraceptives was high (>60%); however, condom use during sexual intercourse with a new partner was low (23%), even among the highly educated women (32.7%) and women who stated to have received information on the risks and benefits of condom use (26.0%). Although condom use among the highly educated women was low, it was still 2 times higher than among the lower educated women, 15.7% (p < 0.001). There was also less condom use among the women with multiple sexual partners compared to single-partnered women (p = 0.001).Conclusion: More than a decade after the inception of the Millennium Development Goals, there is still work to be done in Ghana, especially on education and sexual violence. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.","Abortion; Africa; contraceptive use; Ghana; observational study; sexual and reproductive health and rights; unwanted sexual experience; WHO's millennium development goals","contraceptive agent; abortion; adult; Article; cancer screening; condom use; experience; female; Ghana; human; human rights; information; major clinical study; middle aged; observational study; reproductive health; risk; sexual health; sexual intercourse; sexual violence; sexuality; uterine cervix cancer; world health organization; contraceptive behavior; epidemiology; needs assessment; reproductive health; reproductive history; sexual behavior; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; women's rights; Adult; Contraception Behavior; Female; Ghana; Humans; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Reproductive Health; Reproductive History; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Rights; World Health Organization",,,0167482X,,JPOGD,26328772,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946500586

The historical record has been interpreted to identify future trends and challenges related to food labelling. These challenges are arising in Thailand and many similar emerging economies.Thailand has a good reputation in world food markets and is now becoming a global leader in food production and export. It has become deeply involved with regulations and standards applied by World Trade Organization and Codex Alimentarius while serving its own population with a safe and secure food supply. For consumers considering Thai food products, food labels can provide useful nutrition information and help build trust.Thais began a century ago with policies and laws to enhance food safety and to protect Thai consumers. During the lengthy journey from national to global standards Thai food labels have evolved and now contribute to international food labelling policies. This contribution comes from the perspective of a leading middle income south-east Asian food producer now trading with high income countries around the world. The story of that journey - a case study for many other countries in a similar situation - has not previously been told.This article provides information for policy makers dealing with food labelling, embedding trends and tensions for one middle income food exporter in a long history.

After reviewing the impact of these problems on the evolution of the main postwar approaches to development, the article undertakes the task of reconstruction in three steps. First, it sets out Marx’s understanding of capitalist modernity, showing how this calls for but does not explicitly provide a historical conceptualization of capitalist development. Second, it shows how Trotsky’s idea of “uneven and combined development” offers such a conceptualization, and how it thereby historicizes the phenomenon of development itself. Finally, it considers the limits of Trotsky’s own formulation of the idea, and suggests how a version released from these limits could better explain the complex spatio-temporality of capitalist development and constructively engage the most consequential challenges posed by ascendant cultural approaches in the field. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Capitalism; Development theory; Social theory; Spatio-temporality; World history",,,,03042421,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943201209

People often use hand-crafted features (e.g. lanes, traffic lights, intersections) based on programmers' knowledge about the environment. Those agents are usually brittle during real-world tests. However, landmarks, as a type of object, need to be recognized for an autonomous navigation system to generalize its learned training data to other unfamiliar environments. In this work we utilize the Developmental Network (DN), which has been tested extensively with object recognition tasks, for a mobile agent and train it to self-navigate in controlled indoor environment. The proposed system uses Lobe Component Analysis (LCA) to learn features from both stereo cameras and desired navigation actions. Neurons attend to different areas of the input image. They compete for firing according to the goodness of matching result. This enables the agent to attend to image local patches as landmarks without explicitly defining objects. Our analysis shows that attention can be corrected by direct supervision and by indirect reinforcement provided by the teacher. We anticipate our work in this paper to be a starting point of research efforts that shift expensive range-scanner-based methods to inexpensive camera-based methods that, although using richer information, face challenges of object appearance variations. © 2015 IEEE.","Computational modeling; Fires; History; Navigation; Neurons; Pediatrics; Testing","Cameras; Fires; History; Image segmentation; Mobile agents; Navigation; Navigation systems; Neural networks; Neurons; Pediatrics; Stereo image processing; Teaching; Testing; Autonomous driving; Autonomous navigation systems; Component analysis; Computational model; Indoor environment; Object appearance; Real-world tests; Research efforts; Object recognition",,,,9781479919604; 9781479919604; 9781479919604; 9781479919604,85OFA,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951111844

Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, United States; Georgetown University, 37th and O Street, NW, Washington, DC, United States","The second world cholera pandemic in Europe (1829–1849) was significant because of its geographic extent and the enormous numbers of people who fell ill or died. It was also singularly important because it demonstrated the profound levels of ignorance in both Europe and North America concerning the cause, modes of transmission, and treatment of cholera. This paper discusses the pandemic in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in great detail. Even though medical and public health authorities in this kingdom had several years to prepare for cholera’s eventual arrival in 1836–1837, their elaborate preventive and therapeutic measures proved no more successful than elsewhere. Despite their efforts, it was estimated that there were 32,145 cases of cholera in the city of Naples by July 1837. Some 19,470 people were estimated to have died among the city’s then 357,283 population. This amounted to a cholera-specific mortality rate of 54.5/1000 population. Sicily was also severely affected by the epidemic. It was estimated that 69,000 people died of cholera in Sicily, 24,000 of them in the city of Palermo. Two rural towns in the kingdom, San Prisco and Forio d’Ischia, were selected for in-depth epidemiologic study. The former had a population of 3700 in 1836–1837, while the latter had a population of 5500. The economic basis of both towns was agriculture. However, because Forio is located on an island, fishing and sea transport were then also important industries. Cholera appeared in San Prisco in July 1837 and quickly swept through the population. By August, the epidemic was essentially over. It is estimated that some 109 people died from cholera in San Prisco for a disease-specific mortality rate of 29.5/1000 population. The age range of those who died from cholera was 1 to 90 years. The majority of deaths (60.6 %) were among women. The first cases of cholera appeared in Forio d’Ischia in June 1837. The epidemic then peaked in July. It is estimated that approximately 316 people died from cholera in Forio out of a population of 5500. This resulted in a cholera-specific mortality rate of 57.5/1000 population. Among the first 42 fatal cases in whom the disease was documented on their death certificates, ages ranged from 15 to 88 years. The mean age was 52.4 years. The majority of deaths (57.1 %) were among women. We reached beyond the statistics of this epidemic by presenting an in-depth study of the first person to die from cholera in Forio d’Ischia, Nicola Antonio Insante. By focusing on him, we were able to develop a broad account of the social and economic consequences of his death on his family. At the same time, our research demonstrated the resiliency of his immediate and distant descendants. Similarly, we discuss the D’Ambra and Scola families of Forio d’Ischia, and the Caruso and Valenziano families of San Prisco, among whom a number died from cholera in 1837. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cholera in Forio d’Ischia; Cholera in San Prisco; Cholera in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; Descendants of the 1837 cholera pandemic victims; Nicola Insante; Second world cholera pandemic","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; child; cholera; female; history; human; infant; Italy; male; middle aged; pandemic; preschool child; quarantine; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; vital statistics; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholera; Female; History, 19th Century; Humans; Infant; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Quarantine; Sex Distribution; Sicily; Vital Statistics; Young Adult",,,00945145,,JCMHB,26377228,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945474352

Much like the web of documents, linked data resources continuously evolve over time, but for the most part only their most recent state is accessible. In order to investigate the evolution of linked datasets and how changes propagate through the web of data it is necessary to make prior versions of such resources available. The lack of a common ""self-service"" versioning platform in the linked data community makes it more difficult for dataset maintainers to preserve past states of their data themselves. By implementing such a platform which also provides a consistent interface to historic dataset information, dataset maintainers can more easily start versioning their datasets while application developers and researchers instantly have the possibility of working with the additional temporal data without laboriously collecting it on their own.

In doing so, it sets out to do three things. The first is to consider how metropolitan theory “travels,” takes root, and has particular, local effects as part of a disciplinary ordering of knowledge and practice. In South Africa, the advent of contract archaeology around the time of the 1994 elections was ironic in the sense that it foreclosed on the notion of a “people’s archaeology,” replacing it with forms of corporate accountability and models of business best practice. The second broad aim is to think about what is at stake in the politics of memory after apartheid, and the effects of contract archaeology in mediating and mitigating popular struggles around rights, resources and representation. I argue that, in many cases, the function of contract archaeology is to discipline and school such struggles, diverting them along approved tracks and bureaucratic channels. The third is to think about how contract archaeology functions as part of global coloniality, as an instigator and enabler of global designs.

In addition, we here review and highlight the eminent role of natural history collections in exploring the global species diversity by discussing the current conditions of institutional infrastructure in biologically megadiverse developing countries (MDCs). To our knowledge, this is the first critical assessment, which primarily focuses on these biologically wealthy nations. We show that in addition to the taxonomists’ shortage, the lack of well-maintained collection infrastructure represents the main bottleneck for biodiversity exploration in MDCs. No campaign to inventory biodiversity at national or global scale in a foreseeable timeframe can be successful without the creation of more positions for taxonomists and the expansion of existing or the establishment of new natural history collections in MDCs, respectively. Considering the lack of sufficient financial resources in many MDCs, we suggest that joint political priority of industrialized and developing countries should be given to the enduring maintenance and sustainable support of institutional infrastructures, if Convention on Biological Diversity targets for 2020 are to be addressed expediently. © 2015, Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik.","Biodiversity collections; Biodiversity loss; Developing countries; Megadiversity countries; Species discovery; Taxonomy","biodiversity; developing world; exploration; inventory; life history theory; population bottleneck; theoretical study",,,14396092,,ODERA,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940894459

At the first meeting under the new rulers in 1934, von Eggeling and Siegfried Mollier prevented their board colleague Martin Heidenhain from giving an introductory talk because they (not unjustly) feared anti-Jewish protests, but also because many anatomy professors, like other German scholars, were fervent nationalists who welcomed Hitler and largely accepted the expulsion of Jewish and other colleagues as 'inevitable' for national renewal. Many persecuted members nevertheless remained on the membership lists and the AG never officially introduced anti-Jewish bylaws. Eggeling and his like-minded colleagues successfully defended the international status of the AG, though not so much against the Nazi authorities but against a younger generation of anatomists who were willing to benefit from the new political situation and strived for their own German anatomical association.The available archival material suggests that the motivation of the established leading members of the AG to take this specific path was not rooted in opposition to the new rulers but rather in defence of their traditional status of reputed professors running a time-honoured, world leading society. This made international reputation an important guideline for many decisions. While they did ward off attempts by the younger generation to politicise the AG, their post-war calls for an apolitical science remain ambivalent, as their own stance had not always been apolitical. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","Anatomische Gesellschaft; Apolitical science; Curt Elze; Heinrich von Eggeling; National Socialism; Persecuted members; Robert Wetzel","anatomy; consensus development; motivation; political system; practice guideline; running; standing; cadaver; history; human; Jew; medical society; political system; university; war; war crime; Cadaver; History, 20th Century; Humans; Jews; National Socialism; Societies, Medical; Universities; War Crimes; World War II",,,09409602,,ANANE,26117073,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952049815

The latter is otherwise hidden within a more complex discursive structure, designated by Wallerstein as the “centrist liberal geoculture”. The issue is the process of maturation that with good reason calls for an appropriate anamnesis and an explanation of the genesis of modern world-system. In the perspective of the philosophy of history, we should ask: what the future’s past can tell us about our present? Although Voltaire’s combination of the faith in moderate progress with the selective type of sinophilia indicates the birth of the modern philosophy of history and its universality, the latter is by the same token compromised as the symptom of eurocentrism. Still, the modern affirmation of historical science marks the fatal disintegration of universal time into the number of separate temporalities and historicities. It is for this reason that the advocacy of “total history” is conceivable only within the transgressive and holistic constellation of research which is unimaginable without the philosophy of history. The paper seeks to demonstrate this through the use of the deconstruction of still dominant periodization and cultural-historical epochs that are traditionally derived by means of exclusion of the contributions of different cultures and epochs. © 2015, Hrvatsko Filozofsko Drustvo.

Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of women with Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy was conducted at three teaching hospitals to ascertain whether they had earlier GDM, and to determine whether this is associated with differences in measures of pregnancy planning and diabetes management. Results: Of 172 index pregnancies affected by Type 2 diabetes, in 76 (44%) cases, the mother had a previous history of GDM. Within this cohort, a diagnosis of 'overt diabetes in pregnancy', made on the basis of a GTT result during pregnancy in the WHO diabetic range with persistent diabetes post partum, was more common among women who had previous GDM than women who had not had GDM (20% vs 7%, P = 0.02). Women who previously had GDM did not exhibit a higher incidence of preconception planning or folate supplementation. Conclusions: It is common for women with Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy to have had GDM previously.

If trials are conducted in secret, patient safety is at risk. Several mandates - legal, editorial, financial, and ethical - have tried to influence the disclosure of clinical trials, first by encouraging registration in publicly accessible registers and, second, by calling for the publication of results. Not all these initiatives have reached high rates of compliance, but the succession of national and international events over a few years gave an important boost to information disclosure. This article provides a chronicle of the succession of the events, from the historical calls to the recent EMA policy and WHO statement, and public consultations requested by the NIH, and the HHS, which will inevitably change the international panorama. The path of these new policies is moving towards more supervised clinical research.

Zipper thought that a similar scarring effect could occur in the fallopian tubes if quinacrine was instilled into the uterine cavity. A series of refinements of the methodology culminated in the use of a modified Copper T intrauterine device inserter tube as a delivery system to introduce seven quinacrine pellets into the uterus. This approach with quinacrine sterilization (QS) was introduced into clinical practice in several countries, and a national clinical trial of over 50,000 women was conducted in Vietnam. However, in 1993, the World Health Organization raised concerns that quinacrine might be carcinogenic. This resulted in abandonment of QS in Vietnam and other countries.

After the Silk Road opened during the Han Dynasty, Buddhist scriptures were introduced to Western countries) during the Tang Dynasty. China's outstanding maritime activities began in the Song Dynasty, and then ancient China's Four Great Inventions (the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing) spread to the West. This led to exchanges between Chinese and foreigners, and helped amass a wealth of Chinese and foreign geographical and mapping data. In the third century AD, the ""Hawn biography"" put forward six theories and methods of cartography. Its continuous legacy and improvement of the map of China until the Yuan Dynasty demonstrated that traditional mapping theories and methods had improved and tended to be mature. The data used in this study cover the Ming and Qing dynasties and spans nearly 600 years (AD 1368-1911), including more than 25 kinds of typical world maps. This paper analyzes the historical backgrounds of world maps, with the discussion of their features, contributions, and roles. The main conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Ancient Chinese civilization and its economic power took the lead in the world for a long period, prior to the Western creation of a complete world map. (2) Under the more conservative policies of the ""closed"" imperial power in the Ming and Qing dynasties, world maps showed a focus on five relatively open boom time trajectories. (3) Five distinct traits and achievements characterize ancient Chinese world maps-ahead of the West to complete world map, abundant accumulation of data, advantages of traditional cartography, illustrated models, and the first fusion of Chinese and Western approaches. (4) Different periods of world maps provide new contents that speaks to the spread of world geographic & history knowledge and etc., and plays an important role in promoting social progress, which shows that ancient Chinese world maps have important historical value and practical significance. © 2015, Science Press.

Methods: Sixty-one Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Persian Gulf War Veterans with a history of mild or moderate TBI, more than 6 months postinjury, and 21 demographically matched Veteran controls were administered self-report measures of QOL (World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF) and postconcussive symptom severity (Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory). Results: Perceived QOL was significantly worse in Veterans with mild-moderate TBI than in controls. In the TBI group, QOL was predominantly associated with affective symptoms, and moderate to strong correlations with fatigue and depression were evident across all QOL areas. Multivariate analyses revealed depression and fatigue to be the best predictors of Psychological, Social, and Environmental QOL, whereas sleep difficulty best predicted Physical QOL in mild-moderate TBI. Conclusion: Veterans with post-acute mild-moderate TBI evidence worse QOL than demographically matched Veteran controls. Affective symptoms, and specifically those of fatigue, depression, and sleep difficulty, appear to be the most relevant postconcussive symptoms predicting QOL in this population. These findings underscore the importance of examining specific symptoms as they relate to post-acute TBI QOL and provide guidance for treatment and intervention studies. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The IV-VII centuries were recorded in the history of Eurasia and Europe as the era of the Great Migration. The Great Migration was a turning point in world history, the foundation of which was laid by the Hunnish tribal union moving from the depths of Central Asia to the western parts of the European continent. Studying and teaching the history of the Huns in terms of the interrelation between world and national history is of great theoretical and practical significance for university education. Additionally, in the history of Europe and Eurasia, world history specialists should start a systematic study of the long-standing problems of the Turkic world history of this period. First of all, it is the history of the Avarian Kaganate of the VI-VIII centuries, the Turkic speaking Avars, who came from the Eurasian steppes to the Huns’ former settlements in Pannonia. There is a need for an objective exposition of the history of the West and the East during the period of the Crusades.

Coprolites were collected from different stratified sequences dating from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition to the late Holocene. Paleoparasitological examination revealed the presence of eggs of Trichostrongylidae attributed to Lamanema chavezi or Nematodirus lamae, eggs of three unidentified capillariids, Strongylus-type eggs and oocysts of Eimeria macusaniensis. These parasites affected camelids living in the studied area since the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, about 10,000 years ago. Gastrointestinal parasite fauna of patagonian camelids did not vary significatively from Pleistocene-Holocene transition to late Holocene, although environmental conditions fluctuated greatly throughout this period, as indicative of the strength and the stability of these associations over time.

The Third Reich, for which a detailed study already exists, will be mentioned as well to allow better evaluation of the periods before and after National Socialism. Based on newly evaluated archival material and body journals which will be examined both quantitatively and qualitatively, it becomes apparent that the Cologne institute experienced a chronic shortage of bodies both during the Weimar Republic and the first post-war decade (even though the delivery facilities were mostly the same).

Why do the memories of difficult experiences endure, and even intensify, despite people's impulse to avoid remembering a dreadful past and to move on? This book explores these questions by examining Japan's culture of defeat up to the present day. It surveys the stakes of war memory in Japan after its defeat in World War II and shows how and why defeat has become an indelible part of national collective life, especially in recent decades. Drawing on ethnographic observations and personal interviews as well as testimonials and other popular memory data since the 1980s, it probes into the heart of the divisive war memories that lie at the root of current disputes over revising Japan's pacifist constitution, remilitarization, and the escalating frictions in East Asia that have come to be known collectively as Japan's ""history problem."" This book examines this divisive national project, drawing on the sociological insights of cultural trauma theory and collective memory theory. Contrary to the Western stereotype that describes Japan as suffering from ""collective amnesia,"" Japan's war memories are deeply encoded in the everyday culture and much more varied than the caricatured image suggests. The book identifies three conflicting trauma narratives in Japan's war memories-narratives of victims, perpetrators, and fallen heroes-that are motivated by the desire to heal the wounds, redress the wrongs, and restore a positive moral and national identity. © Oxford University Press 2015.

Method: The most relevant historical sources have been evaluated.

The development of surgery of colon, rectum and anus is reported with particular reference to the social environment and history; as the development of colorectal surgery parallels the occurrence of human historical events, the study of the former cannot be disjoined from the latter.

Smoking among males and consanguineous marriages are frequent. A previous study showed elevated rates of major malformations within groups from this population residing near an industrial park, where high ambient values of arsenic (As) and nickel (Ni) were detected, compared to groups living in remote localities. Objectives: We estimated the extent of exposure to metals in pregnant Bedouin-Arab women in relation to congenital malformations. Methods: We collected maternal urine samples from 140 Bedouin women who gave birth in a local hospital. Patient medical history, type of marriage (consanguineous or non-consanguineous), and parental exposure history were collected by interview and medical records. Results: Aluminum (Al) was detected in 37 women (26.4%), cadmium (Cd) in 2 (1.4%), As in 10 (7.1%), and Ni in 1 woman (0.7%). The detected rate of Cd exposure was low, though more than 92% of the fathers reported smoking. Concentrations of Al were higher for women residing within 10 km of the local industrial park (Prevalence Ratio (PR). = 1.12, p-value. = 0.012) or who reported using a wood burning stove (PR. = 1.37, p-value. = 0.011) and cooking over an open fire (PR. = 1.16, p-value. = 0.076).Exposure to Al was adversely associated with minor anomalies (OR. = 3.8, p-value. = 0.046) after adjusting for history of abortions (OR. = 6.1, p-value. = 0.007). Fetuses prenatally exposed to As were born prematurely (p-value. = 0.001) and at lower weights (pv. = 0.023). Conclusions: The study population of pregnant women is exposed to high levels of metals mainly of household origin.

Based on sources from German, Belgian, and British archives and publications, it considers the issue of military transport and supply in the thick of war. Traditional histories of World War I tend to be those of battles, but what follows is a history of roads and footpaths. More than a million Africans served as porters for the troops. Many paid with their lives. The organization of military labor was a huge task for the colonial and military bureaucracies for which they were hardly prepared. However, the need to organize military transport eventually initiated a process of modernization of the colonial state in the Belgian Congo and British East Africa. This process was not without backlash or failure. The Germans lost their well-developed military transport infrastructure during the Allied offensive of 1916. The British and Belgians went to war with the question of transport unresolved. They were unable to recruit enough Africans for military labor, a situation made worse by failures in the supplies by porters of food and medical care. One of the main factors that contributed to the success of German forces was the Allies' failure in the ""war of legs.""1.","Colonial history; Colonial labor; Colonial modernity; East African campaign; World War I",,,,20454813,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973862031

As such, this study was conducted to report the durations of the intensive and continuation phases of TB treatment and their predictors among new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients in Malaysia. Study design: Descriptive, non-experimental, follow-up cohort study. Methods: This study was conducted at the Chest Clinic of Penang General Hospital between March 2010 and February 2011. The medical records and TB notification forms of all new smear-positive PTB patients, diagnosed during the study period, were reviewed to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data. Based on standard guidelines, the normal benchmarks for the durations of the intensive and continuation phases of PTB treatment were taken as two and four months, respectively. A patient in whom the clinicians decided to extend the intensive phase of treatment by ≥2 weeks was categorized as a case with a prolonged intensive phase. The same criterion applied for the continuation phase. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to find independent factors associated with the duration of TB treatment. Data were analyzed using Predictive Analysis Software Version 19.0. Results: Of the 336 patients included in this study, 261 completed the intensive phase of treatment, and 226 completed the continuation phase of treatment. The mean duration of TB treatment (n = 226) was 8.19 (standard deviation 1.65) months. Half (49.4%, 129/261) of the patients completed the intensive phase of treatment in two months, whereas only 37.6% (85/226) of the patients completed the continuation phase of treatment in four months. On multiple logistic regression analysis, being a smoker, being underweight and having a history of cough for ≥4 weeks at TB diagnosis were found to be predictive of a prolonged intensive phase of treatment. Diabetes mellitus and the presence of lung cavities at the start of treatment were the only predictors found for a prolonged continuation phase of treatment. Conclusions: The average durations of the intensive and continuation phases of treatment among PTB patients were longer than the targets recommended by the World Health Organization. As there are no internationally agreed criteria, it was not possible to judge how well the Malaysian NTP performed in terms of managing treatment duration among PTB patients. © 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.","Duration of continuation phase; Duration of intensive phase; Duration of tuberculosis treatment; Malaysia; Penang; Smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis","ethambutol; isoniazid; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; disease control; disease treatment; health services; medicine; regression analysis; respiratory disease; tuberculosis; adult; Article; Chinese; cohort analysis; comorbidity; continuation phase; coughing; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hypertension; intensive phase; lung cavity; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; Malay (people); Malaysia; male; medical history; middle aged; practice guideline; risk factor; smoking; Tamil (people); treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment planning; underweight; follow up; international cooperation; medical record; practice guideline; standards; time; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; world health organization; Malaysia; Penang; West Malaysia; Adult; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Internationality; Malaysia; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Time Factors; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; World Health Organization",,,00333506,,PUHEA,25999175,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931569933

The historical summary focuses on societal transformations caused by political changes and historical tragedies during the 20th century. One explicit goal is to show in which ways the Inner 7th District of Budapest is unique among similar historic districts of other Central European cities: in Central European comparison, a large proportion of its population - just like the Jewish population of Budapest in general - survived the Holocaust. Therefore Jewish heritage has been experienced differently there than elsewhere in cities of the region. After briefly introducing the historical evolution of the Inner 7th District before World War II, the article portrays local society, and explores the social relations that characterized this area until the last years of the World War II. Patterns of ethnic and confessional intermixing will be interpreted as defining characteristics of the district in the interwar period. Then the author will show the way wartime events and political measures disrupted the social fabric of the neighborhood, and transformed the local population dramatically by the spring of 1945. At the same time, patterns of survival will be also emphasized. After discussing the impact of World War II and the Holocaust, the article will highlight the post-1945 shifts in local society, exploring the impact of migration as well as the connection between societal transformation and the area's physical decay in the Communist period. Finally, the author will briefly touch upon the past 25 years, discussing the possibilities of revival in the area, pointing out the role of Jewish heritage in the recent rediscovery of the neighborhood. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Budapest; Heritage; Holocaust; Hungary; Jewish history; Migration; Urban renewal; Urban society; World war II",,,,02366568,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958087393

The badness of suffering casts doubt on the goodness of the world. In asking whether human history has been worth it, we are asking whether the horrors and the suffering have been outweighed, so that human history has been, on the whole, good. Pessimists answer No. On their view, human existence is on the whole bad, or worse than nothing. Friedrich Nietzsche struggled to avoid this form of Pessimism. One of Nietzsche's responses was his attempt to make the world good, by saying Yes to everything. In other passages, Nietzsche claims instead that we cannot intelligibly ask whether it has all been worth it. This chapter argues that, in Utilitarian hedonistic terms, the past has been worth it, since the sum of happiness has been greater than the sum of suffering. Even if the past has been in itself bad, the future may be good, and this goodness might outweigh the badness of the past. © Susan Wolf, Allen Wood, Barbara Herman, and T. M. Scanlon 2011.

Using measurement units in various locations|Asia, Europe, and the United States|we show that foreign users are highly vulnerable to the NSA's dragnet surveillance due to the concentration of third-party trackers in the U.S. Finally, we find that some browser-based privacy tools mitigate the attack while others are largely ineffective.",,"Monitoring; Units of measurement; Websites; World Wide Web; Browsing history; Legal restriction; Network measurement; Passive eavesdroppers; Physical locations; Privacy tools; Third parties; Web measurements; HTTP",,,,9781450334693,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992238873

Such a strategy would create opportunities for more women to receive timely treatment for GDM. Developing a consensus on screening for GDM in Europe is challenging, as populations are diverse and healthcare delivery systems also differ. The European Board & College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (EBCOG) has responded to this challenge by appointing a steering committee, including members of the EBCOG and the Diabetic Pregnancy Study Group (DPSG) associated with the EASD, to develop a proposal for the use of uniform diagnostic criteria for GDM in Europe. A proposal has been developed and has now been approved by the Council of the EBCOG. The current proposal is to screen for overt diabetes at the first prenatal contact using cut-off values for diabetes outside pregnancy, with particular efforts made to screen high-risk groups. When screening for GDM is performed at 24 weeks’ gestation or later, the proposal is now to use the 75 g OGTT with the new WHO diagnostic criteria for GDM. However, more research is necessary to evaluate the best GDM screening strategy for different populations in Europe. Therefore, no clear recommendation has been made on whether a universal one-step, two-step or a risk-factor-based screening approach should be used. The use of the same WHO diagnostic GDM criteria across Europe will be an important step towards uniformity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Diagnostic criteria; Gestational diabetes; Proposal; Screening","Article; Europe; female; gestational age; glucose intolerance; health care delivery; high risk population; human; mass screening; medical history; medical society; oral glucose tolerance test; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; priority journal; risk factor; adult; Diabetes, Gestational; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance test; gynecology; obstetrics; pregnancy; standard; standards; world health organization; Adult; Diabetes, Gestational; Europe; Female; Glucose Intolerance; Glucose Tolerance Test; Gynecology; Humans; Mass Screening; Obstetrics; Pregnancy; Reference Standards; Risk Factors; World Health Organization",,,0012186X,,DBTGA,25952480,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931563974

Results: Clearly, the significance of the x-ray storm unit was increasingly subordinated to the necessities of the war until its original objectives disappeared from focus completely. The main purpose of operation of the x-ray storm unit thus by no means lay in the early detection of tuberculosis and did not therefore serve tuberculosis control.

This study examines whether the above association differs in conflict settings, which have the potential for both higher levels of violence and more limited access to family planning. We use nationally representative data from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to examine the relationship between individual- and community-level IPV and modern contraceptive use, and to explore whether conflict modifies the relationship between IPV and contraceptive use. Nationally, only 6% of women reported current modern contraceptive use, while 53% reported experiencing physical IPV and 32% reported experiencing sexual IPV. In multivariate models, we found that individual-level sexual IPV was positively associated with current using modern contraceptive use, but that a combined measure of physical and sexual IPV did not demonstrate a similar association. Community-level IPV was not associated with individual-level contraceptive use. Conflict exposure was neither an independent predictor nor modifier of contraceptive use. Results suggest improved access to family planning should be a priority for programming in DRC, and efforts should ensure that sufficient resources are allocated towards the reproductive health needs of women in both conflict and non-conflict regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conflict; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Family planning; Intimate partner violence; Modern contraception; Sexual violence","contraceptive agent; contraceptive agent; contraceptive use; developing world; family planning; multivariate analysis; reproductive health; violence; womens health; adolescent; adult; Article; community assessment; conflict; Congo; controlled study; data analysis; environmental factor; family planning; female; geographic distribution; human; male; medical history; middle aged; oral contraceptive use; outcome assessment; partner violence; personal experience; prediction; social interaction; young adult; contraceptive behavior; Democratic Republic Congo; health survey; psychology; risk factor; sexuality; violence; war; Congo; Adolescent; Adult; Contraception Behavior; Contraceptive Agents; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Spouse Abuse; Violence; War; Young Adult",,,02779536,,SSMDE,25828259,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925751425

Recently, the World Health Organization developed the End TB Strategy, with an overall goal of a 90% reduction in TB incidence and a 95% reduction in TB deaths from 2015-2035. As the TB burden shifts to older individuals and China's overall population ages, it is unclear if maintaining the current DOTS strategy will be sufficient for China to reach the global targets. Methods: We developed an individual-based computational model of TB transmission, implementing realistic age demographics and fitting to country-level data of age-dependent prevalence over time. We explored the trajectory of TB burden if the DOTS strategy is maintained or if new interventions are introduced using currently available and soon-to-be-available tools. These interventions include increasing population coverage of DOTS, reducing time to treatment, increasing treatment success, and active case finding among elders > 65 years old. We also considered preventative therapy in latently infected elders, a strategy limited by resource constraints and the risk of adverse events. Results: Maintenance of the DOTS strategy reduces TB incidence and mortality by 42% (95% credible interval, 27-59%) and 41% (5-64%), respectively, between 2015 and 2035. A combination of all feasible interventions nears the 2035 mortality target, reducing TB incidence and mortality by 59% (50-76%) and 83% (73-94%). Addition of preventative therapy for elders would enable China to nearly reach both the incidence and mortality targets, reducing incidence and mortality by 84% (78-93%) and 92% (86-98%). Conclusions: The current decline in incidence is driven by two factors: maintaining a low level of new infections in young individuals and the aging out of older latently infected individuals who contribute incidence due to reactivation disease. While further reducing the level of new infections has a modest effect on burden, interventions that limit reactivation have a greater impact on TB burden. Tools that make preventative therapy more feasible on a large scale and in elders will help China achieve the global targets. © 2015 Huynh et al.","China; DOTS; Global targets; Latent reservoir; Reactivation; Tuberculosis","bedaquiline; Article; calibration; China; clinical pathway; demography; disease transmission; health care access; human; medical history; mortality; postprimary tuberculosis; prevalence; short course therapy; treatment outcome; tuberculosis control; world health organization; adolescent; adult; aged; directly observed therapy; female; incidence; male; middle aged; procedures; theoretical model; transmission; tuberculosis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; China; Directly Observed Therapy; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Prevalence; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis; World Health Organization; Young Adult",,,17417015,,,25896465,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929324040

There are few close-ups, and takes are ponderously long. The focus is on grand strategy, and an attendant grand narrative; the lens offers a blow-by-blow assessment of the massive assault. Shot in 1998, Saving Private Ryan periodically echoes this perspective but reflects modalities informed by changing technologies and a hyper-mediated culture. The result is more intimate framing, punctuated by shots sometimes adapted from the source material: footage captured on Omaha Beach, 6 June 1944, by the Signal Corps cameramen. This portrayal serves two purposes: it opens the film in spectacular fashion, introduces the main characters and prefaces their mission. This article identifies and examines filmic frames from the day of the landings; from the grand narrative of The Longest Day; and from Spielberg's confronting representation Saving Private Ryan. The aim is to show how, through the lens alone, cinematographers approximate the character of a tumultuous and terrifying day in ways that are surprisingly similar and profoundly different. © The Author(s) 2014.","cinema; cinematography; D-Day; history; war; World War II",,,,17506352,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926456045

It saw the birth and demise of unity states (the United Arab Republic and the Arab Union), civil war, revolution and Western intervention. Despite its short five-month lifespan, the Iraqi–Jordanian Hashemite Arab Union contributed to the intensification of the traditional Egyptian–Iraqi rivalry, the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958 and the American intervention in Lebanon the same year. It was the result of Arab nationalism, lingering British imperial dreams, the East–West conflict, economic considerations and an inter-Arab cold war. The Arab Union had obvious advantages over the United Arab Republic. Two such advantages were the greater number of cabinet posts granted to Jordan by the Arab Union than were granted to Syria by the United Arab Republic, and the fact that Amman retained its status as capital (one of two union capitals), whereas Damascus was downgraded to the status of provincial capital. These advantages, however, failed to prevent the premature demise of the union, which was caused by a combination of negative domestic and regional perceptions, economic constraint and military commitments. © 2015 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.",,"Arab world; Cold War; nationalism; social history; Jordan; Lebanon; Syrian Arab Republic",,,13530194,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924073810

Drapes’ career was as complex as it was remarkable. Drapes was elected president of the Medico-Psychological Association for the term 1911–12 but had to decline on health grounds. In 1912, however, he was unanimously elected as co-editor of the Journal of Mental Science, to which he devoted his considerable energies and intellect. Drapes published widely, opposing Emil Kraepelin’s proposed division of “functional” psychosis into manic-depressive illness and dementia praecox; openly examining the use of “punitive measures” in asylums (Enniscorthy had notably low rates of restraint and seclusion); and publicly bemoaning the folly of “psychophysical parallelism”, or the spurious division between mental and physical symptoms in medicine. Although not immune to passing trends in medical thought (e.g. regarding sterilisation of the mentally ill to prevent further mental disorder), Drapes was generally independent-minded, insightful and incisive, and his legacy was to help shape Irish mental health care for many decades. © 2015, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.","Diagnosis; History; Ireland; Mental disorder; Psychiatrist; Psychiatry","Article; bipolar disorder; consultation; DSM-5; human; mental health care; mortality; patient care; physician; psychoanalysis; psychosis; schizophrenia; world health organization; history; Ireland; mental hospital; psychiatry; X chromosome linked disorder; Bipolar Disorder; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Ireland; Psychiatry; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia",,,00211265,,IJMSA,25833354,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940435217

We also examined the changes in the prevalence using the criteria of International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG). Methods: In 2010-2012, 18589 women who registered within 12 weeks of gestation underwent a glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24-28 gestational weeks. Amongst them, 2953 women with 1-hour plasma glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L underwent a 75-gram 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 781 women had a positive GCT but absented from the standard OGTT. An adjusted prevalence of GDM was calculated for the whole cohort of women by including an estimate of the proportion of women with positive GCTs who did not have OGTTs but would have been expected to have GDM. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using the IADPSG criteria. The prevalence of GDM risk factors was compared to the 1999 survey. Results: The adjusted prevalence of GDM by the 1999 WHO criteria was 8.1%, a 3.5-fold increase as in 1999. Using the IADPSG criteria increased the adjusted prevalence further to 9.3%. Advanced age, higher pre-pregnancy body mass index, Han-nationality, higher systolic blood pressure (BP), a family history of diabetes, weight gain during pregnancy and habitual smoking were risk factors for GDM. Compared to the 1999 survey, the prevalence of overweight plus obesity had increased by 1.8 folds, age >30 years by 2.3 folds, systolic BP by 2.3 mmHg over the 12-year period. Conclusions: Increasing prevalence of overweight/obesity and older age at pregnancy were accompanied by increasing prevalence of GDM, further increased by change in diagnostic criteria. © 2015 Leng et al.",,"glucose; adult; Article; body mass; China; Chinese; cohort analysis; controlled study; family history; female; gestational age; glucose blood level; Han Chinese; health survey; human; major clinical study; maternal age; multiple pregnancy; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; population research; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; prevalence; prospective study; risk factor; smoking; systolic blood pressure; trend study; weight gain; world health organization",,,19326203,,POLNC,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925746145

Using the example of Buruli ulcer (BU) and its bacterial etiology, Mycobacterium ulcerans, in south-central Cameroon, we build on debates about the contributions of ""local knowledge"" and ""alternative models"" to biomedical knowledge of disease transmission. BU's mode of transmission remains poorly understood. Our approach employs ethno-ecological histories - local understandings of the putative emergence and expansion of a locally important, neglected disease. We develop these histories from 52 individual and small group interviews, group discussions, and participant-observation of daily and seasonal activities, conducted in 2013-2013. These histories offer important clues about past environmental and social change that should guide further ecological, epidemiological research. They highlight a key historical moment (the late 1980s and 1990s); specific ecological transformations; new cultivation practices in unexploited zones that potentially increased exposure to M.ulcerans; and ecological degradation that may have lowered nutritional standards and heightened susceptibility to BU. They also recast transmission, broadening insight into BU and its local analog, atom, by emphasizing the role of social change and economic crisis in its emergence and expansion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Buruli ulcer; Cameroon; Ecological change; Ethnohistory; One world one health","bacterium; conceptual framework; digestive system disorder; disease transmission; epidemiology; etiology; health status; knowledge; socioeconomic impact; age distribution; agricultural procedures; alternative historical model; Article; bacterial transmission; Buruli ulcer; Cameroon; disease predisposition; ecological degradation; ecological phenomena and functions; ecological transformation; economic aspect; economic crisis; educational status; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental change; environmental exposure; ethno ecological history; fire; forest destruction; history; human; incurable wound; interview; love; melon; Mycobacterium ulcerans; nonbiological model; nonhuman; participant observation; seed culture; social change; social interaction; uncertainty; wound; animal; Buruli ulcer; cultural anthropology; economics; ecosystem; family relation; health; history; isolation and purification; Neglected Diseases; socioeconomics; transmission; Cameroon; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mycobacterium ulcerans; Animals; Anthropology, Cultural; Buruli Ulcer; Cameroon; Ecosystem; Family Relations; Global Health; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Love; Mycobacterium ulcerans; Neglected Diseases; Socioeconomic Factors",,,02779536,,SSMDE,24673887,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923331272

Findings from the complete neurologic examinations in over 200 patients were consolidated into mutually exclusive but all-inclusive neurophysiologic entities called Functional Systems (FS), and these provided the basis for an 11 step 0-10 rank order scale, the Disability Status Scale (DSS). This was used successfully, as well as in the first two Class I treatment trials performed, with the second one also incorporating the 8 FS. Both measures were part of an assessment of a natural history series derived from men hospitalized for MS in the US Army in World War II and followed for some 20 years. Describing each of the 8 FS as affected (1) or normal (0) defined 256 possible patterns of involvement for all patients. Half the patients at diagnosis had one of the 14 most common patterns. Each FS worsened in frequency and severity of involvement in correlation with the DSS, which overall showed a unimodal distribution, until in another series of patients 16 years post onset bimodality first appeared. Observations that the 11 step DSS might have too few steps for treatment trials led to the EDSS of 20 steps with each grade between 1 and 9 divided into two. The system of EDSS+FS to summarize all the CNS involvement as defined by objective findings on neurologic examination thereafter remained unchanged to the present. I just learned that the unpublished system copyrighted in Switzerland as ""neurostatus"" has been called and referenced as my EDSS. It is not. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The accounts of British visitors between 1738 and the end of the century reflect a new historical sensibility, one predicated upon the extraordinary proximity between present and past that these sites seemed to promise. In this essay, Charlotte Roberts examines the work of four individuals - Camillo Paderni, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Sir William Hamilton - all of whom used the prevailing vocabulary associated with Herculaneum and Pompeii in order to articulate individual and in several cases innovative arguments on subjects as diverse as the validity of Neapolitan Bourbon rule, the ideal of Greek art, and the history of the earth. Their ideas indicate that these excavations, in a small but significant way, helped to shape a diverse range of eighteenth-century thought. © 2015 by Henry E.

The findings are useful for those wanting to know the state of homepage design in 2013, whether as current practitioners or researchers. Research questions: (1) What are the current homepage design practices of Fortune 500 companies? (2) What are the current Web 2.0 technology practices of Fortune 500 companies? (3) What changes in homepage design have occurred for Fortune 500 companies? (4) What are the differences in homepage design and Web 2.0 technology practices between the 100 largest and 100 smallest Fortune 500 companies? and (5) Is homogeneity in design increasing amongst Fortune 500 homepages? Literature review: Three key areas guided my analysis of homepages. (1) Usability research, which suggests guidelines for design based on aggregated performance of users, such as locating the search box in the upper right and for directing mobile users to an alternate site designed for mobile access. (2) Design practice studies, which suggest guidelines for design based on aggregated analyses of websites, such as having links to employment information and investor information on the homepage. (3) Design patterns: libraries of patterns to provide designers with responses to design problems, such as using collapsible panels or module tabs to reveal and conceal content on a page. These libraries also provide guidelines for design, such as using fat menus or sitemap footers to structure navigation. Methodology: Using content analysis, every Fortune 500 homepage in 2013 was analyzed for 68 major design elements in these categories - navigation, content links, support for specific types of users, visual design, multimedia, and web 2.0 - and the results were analyzed. Results and conclusions: The homepages displayed greater homogeneity in design than a similar study in 2008. Overall, 12 elements - (1) corporate logo in the top left of the page; (2) link to an 'about us' section containing company information; (3) link to information for those seeking employment; (4) horizontally oriented main navigation; (5) link for contacting the company; (6) link for information for investors; (7) link for terms of use or legal disclaimers; (8) link to privacy information; (9) link for news or a press room; (10) multimedia use; (11) links that do not appear on the page initially, requiring interaction; (12) search box, located in the upper right of page - were present on 80% or more homepages, and 6 elements - (1) web 2.0 features; (2) an image that can be clicked on as a focal point; (3) link to a sitemap; (4) link to Twitter; (5) link to Facebook; and (6) dropdown or pulldown menu - were present on 50% to 79% of pages. Between 2008 and 2013, many practices have changed, such as increases in page length, the overall number of links, the number of links to social media sites, and the number of sites with search boxes. Certain design choices - such as mobile options for sites, links to social media sites, and links to site maps - were more prevalent in the largest 100 companies than the smallest 100 companies. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Corporate internet usage; Facebook; Fortune 500; homepage design; internet; internet history; longitudinal study; social media; Twitter; web design; YouTube","Aggregates; Computer aided network analysis; Design; Internet; Laws and legislation; Libraries; Navigation; Social networking (online); Websites; World Wide Web; Facebook; Fortune 500; Homepage; Internet usage; Longitudinal study; Social media; Twitter; YouTube; Web Design",,,03611434,,IEPCB,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930506844

This leads to bone marrow failure with the resulting peripheral blood cytopenias and evolution to or toward acute myeloid leukaemia that characterize MDS clinically. The clinical heterogeneity of MDS has led several groups to analyze patient and clinical characteristics to develop prognostic scoring systems yielding estimates of overall and leukaemia-free survival to guide clinical decision-making. These models have evolved over time as our understanding of the pathogenesis, natural history, and treatment of MDS has improved. Rapid advances in flow cytometric analysis, adjuncts to standard metaphase cytogenetics, and gene mutation analysis are revolutionizing our understanding of MDS pathogenesis and prognosis.

Ramón y Cajal, 1, Seville, Spain","Seville is a city of 700,000 inhabitants in the south of Spain. It is currently the administrative capital of the region of Andalusia. However, Seville was once the most important city in the Spanish Empire, and a global metropolis when it monopolized trade with 'the Indies'. Its historical past, its subsequent decline and its traditions (many of them religious) generate a range of perceptions among local society as to what the city should be. After being transformed in the wake of the two World Expositions that were staged in the city in the 20th century, at the beginning of the 21st century a change was proposed to Seville's planning model that would not clash with its past. This profile seeks to analyze this period and interpret whether these changes and transformations to the city are part of a consciously created city model and to consider any inconsistencies and internal contradictions. The conclusions show that in periods of large-scale change in the city, the starting-point has to be an agreed city model that enables tradition and modernity to exist side by side, and that is based on greater public participation. The city profile of Seville is significant and useful as an exemplary case of a historic city being capable of renewing the relationship between urban space and the citizen. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Historic city; Seville; Urban conflict; World Expositions","modeling; modernity; public space; urban development; urban history; urban planning; Andalucia; Sevilla; Seville; Spain",,,02642751,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910104122

Design: Cohort study. Setting: National child evacuation scheme in Finland during the second world war. Participants: Children born in Finland between 1933 and 1944 who were later included in a 10% sample of the 1950 Finnish census ascertained in 1997 (n=45 463; women: n=22 021; men: n=23 442). Evacuees in the sample were identified from war time government records. Main outcome measure: Adults admitted to hospital for psychiatric disorders recorded between 1971 and 2011 in the Finnish hospital discharge register. Methods: We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between evacuation to temporary foster care in Sweden during the second world war and admission to hospital for a psychiatric disorder between ages 38 and 78 years. Fixed effects methods were employed to control for all unobserved social and genetic characteristics shared among siblings. Results: Among men and women combined, the risk of admission to hospital for a psychiatric disorder did not differ between Finnish adults evacuated to Swedish foster families and their non-evacuated siblings (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.26). Evidence suggested a lower risk of admission for any mental disorder (0.67, 0.44 to 1.03) among evacuated men, whereas for women there was no association between evacuation and the overall risk of admission for a psychiatric disorder (1.21, 0.80 to 1.83). When admissions for individual psychiatric disorders were analyzed, evacuated girls were significantly more likely than their non-evacuated sisters to be admitted to hospital for a mood disorder as an adult (2.19, 1.10 to 4.33). Conclusions: The Finnish evacuation policy was not associated with an increased overall risk of admission to hospital for a psychiatric disorder in adulthood among former evacuees. In fact, evacuation was associated with a marginally reduced risk of admission for any psychiatric disorder among men. Among women who had been evacuated, however, the risk of being admitted to hospital for a mood disorder was increased. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

While some African intellectuals embraced the new globalist way of analysing literature, there is a strong resistance in African studies against it, as African intellectuals often work with a set of intellectual priorities and philosophical premises that are very different from those who inspired transnational criticism. The article argues, in particular, that world literature theories, just like postcolonial studies before them, perpetuate a vision of African-language literatures as locally constrained, peripheral, and pre-modern. Contrary to this vision, the article claims for African literature a right to disconnectivity on the one hand, and on the other calls for the construction of new epistemological connectivities between Afrophone and Europhone, oral and written literatures. At the same time, though, the transnational turn in the humanities offers some important insights into how to overcome the influence, in African literary criticism, of rigid forms of nativism and nationalism (including linguistic nativism and linguistic nationalism). Following these observations, the article proposes a study of African literature based on the idea of intersecting and multi-layered literary systems, some existing in relative autonomy, some interacting with each other across regions or within the same sociocultural space. © 2014 Journal of African Cultural Studies.","African intellectual history; literary theory; literatures in African languages; oral literature; transnational criticism; world literature",,,,13696815,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921550246

The present paper juxtaposes to Big History an old Big History, namely, the tradition of ""universal history"" that flourished in Europe from the mid-sixteenth century until well into the nineteenth century. The claim to universality of works in that tradition depended on the assumed truth of Christianity, a fact that was fully acknowledged by the tradition's adherents. The claim of the new Big History to universality likewise depends on prior assumptions. Simply stated, in its various manifestations the ""new"" Big History is rooted either in a continuing theology, or in a form of materialism that is assumed to be determinative of human history, or in a somewhat contradictory amalgam of the two. The present paper suggests that ""largest-scale history"" as exemplified in the old and new Big Histories is less a contribution to historical knowledge than it is a narrativization of one or another worldview. Distinguishing between largest-scale history and history that is ""merely"" large-scale, the paper also suggests that a better approach to meeting the desire for large scale in historical writing is through more modest endeavors, such as large-scale comparative history, network and exchange history, thematic history, and history of modernization. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Big History; David Armitage; David Christian; global history; historiographical totalization; Jean Bodin; Jo Guldi; large-scale history; largest-scale history; modernization; Philipp Melanchthon; universal history; world history",,,,1872261X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941205161

The US story of the World War II as a fundamentally political narrative suggests an underlying narrative in which politics, rather than military or economic actions, are the driving force in history. Canadian narratives, on the other hand, portray different images of the war.

Several films and television series about the war and featuring nursing have already been aired. No doubt there will be many more stories to come. Such stories have the potential to do more than eulogise nursing for students and practitioners. Stories, such as The crimson field, have potential to stimulate serious contemplation about values and cultural practices that have remained constant or have changed and to assist students to develop and articulate values that will be fitting for contemporary practice. Recently, excerpts from the series were examined with a group of nursing students and key learnings were found. These are shared in this paper for the benefit of educators planning to utilise public discourse as triggers to engage nursing students in discussions about nursing values, nursing history and representations of the profession. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Creative writing; Education; Film; History of nursing; Narrative; The crimson field","adult; female; history; history of medicine; human; male; middle aged; military nursing; nurse attitude; nursing education; nursing student; procedures; social psychology; television; thinking; verbal communication; war; young adult; Adult; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; History of Nursing; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Nursing; Narration; Nurse's Role; Nursing Education Research; Social Values; Students, Nursing; Television; Thinking; World War I; Young Adult",,,10376178,,,26061166,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964470763

Key advancements in which progress has led to improved outcomes for injured personnel are highlighted--the control and treatment of blood loss, wound care, and the prevention and management of organ failure with optimal resuscitation. Historians often point out how slowly military medicine progressed for the first few thousand years of its recorded history, and how quickly it has progressed in the last century.

The paper will consider the influence of Hofmann and Fischer on the shaping of national scientific institutions in Germany, from founding of the German Chemical Society in 1867 to the first institutes of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society founded in 1911, their academic leadership in other areas including the shaping of a successful academic-industrial symbiosis in organic chemistry, and finally their response to war as a force disruptive of scientific internationalism. All of these developments posed serious dilemmas, exacerbated by emerging strains of nationalism and anti-Semitism in German society. Whereas Hofmann's lifework came to a relatively successful end in 1892, Fischer was not so fortunate, as the war brought him heavy responsibilities and terrible personal losses, but with no German victory and no peace of reconciliation - a bleak end for Fischer and the 19th-century liberal ideals that had inspired him. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,"Biographies; History; 19th century; Academic leadership; German chemical societies; Industrial symbiosis; Organic Chemistry; Science policies; Scientific institutions; World war; International cooperation; chemistry; Germany; history; organization; politics; war; Academies and Institutes; Chemistry; Germany; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Politics; World War I",,,00033790,,ANNSA,26104166,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926638569

That the deconstruction of truth and authority, beginning with the post-war ""baby boom"" and student movements in the United States and Europe, put an end to one metapsychology is yet another example of the power of context upon ideas and praxis.

She and her companions who were prisoners of war during World War II, refused the position of victim and went on to contribute much to the world after their ordeal. Discussion: These women embody important elements of resilience that it is our duty to convey to generations of nurses so that they may be inspired to rise above adversity, foster connection with like-minded others, use adaptive coping mechanisms and soft power, be gentle yet persistent in their resistance practices, and most of all to do good work throughout their nursing careers.This paper argues that oppression theory provides only a limited understanding of present woes affecting nursing. Resilience theory suggests future actions and is therefore further enlightening. By examining the experiences of Bullwinkel, students can be assisted to see that stress has been a constant theme across nursing history. However ways of rising above adversity can be illuminated by critically and deeply examining aspects of iconic leaders and heroic stories such as can be found in the life of Vivian Bullwinkel. Summary: Students who are offered the chance to examine this symbol of strength in our profession may decide to internalise some of the positive traits and resolve to use the behaviours she and her contemporaries used to help them create for themselves a fulfilling career, pride in their profession and strong sense of purpose. © 2014 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.","Adversity; History of nursing; Resilience; Stress; Vivian Bullwinkel","adaptive behavior; art; Australia; coping behavior; female; history; history of medicine; human; mental stress; military nursing; prisoner of war; war; Adaptation, Psychological; Australia; Female; History of Nursing; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Nursing; Prisoners of War; Resilience, Psychological; Stress, Psychological; World War II",,,13227696,,,26285418,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920995883

Relativistic cosmology, developed first by Albert Einstein, depended on military and commercial innovations in telecommunications. Prominent physicists (Hans Reichenbach, Max Born, Paul Langevin, Louis de Broglie, and Léon Brillouin, among others) worked in radio units during WWI and incorporated battlefield lessons into their research. Relativity physicists, working at the intersection of physics and optics by investigating light and electricity, responded to new challenges by developing a novel scientific framework. Ideas about lengths and solid bodies were overhauled because the old Newtonian mechanics assumed the possibility of “instantaneous signaling at a distance.” Einstein’s universe, where time and space dilated, where the shortest path between two points was often curved and non-Euclidean, followed the rules of electromagnetic “signal” transmission. For these scientists, light’s constant speed in the absence of a gravitational field-a fundamental tenet of Einstein’s theory-was a lesson derived from communication technologies. © 2015 by the Society for the History of Technology.",,"devices; Europe; history; light; physics; telecommunication; war; Europe; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Light; Physics; Radio; Telecommunications; World War I",,,0040165X,,,26387524,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941753823

Although CL used to be wellcontrolled and well-documented in Syria, its incidence has dramatically increased since the beginning of the war; however, there is lack of documentation. Here, we present the past and current epidemiological situation of the disease in Syria. We also draw attention to gross and highly unusual clinical variants of CL presented to the Department of Dermatology in Aleppo covering the important differential clinical diagnoses, since this disease is already known to mimic other conditions. Diagnostic procedures and treatment as well as prevention are summarised. Due to the increased ability to travel, and especially the flight of Syrians to neighbouring countries, as well as to Europe, CL may become a new threat in formerly unaffected regions.

Although the previous analyses reported that the children had been excerebrated and eviscerated, no evidence of incisions or breaches of the cranial cavity were found; 3D visualizations were generated showing the brain and the internal organs to be in situ. A larger number of skeletal post-mortem damages were identified, such as dislocation of mandible, ribs, and vertebrae, probably suffered at the time of embalming procedure. Different radio-opaque granular particles were observed throughout bodies (internally and externally) and could be explained as presence of natron, used as external desiccating agent by the embalmers, or as adipocerous alteration, a natural alteration of body fat. Age-at-death was estimated using the 3D visualization of the teeth, the state of fusion of the vertebrae and the presence of the secondary centers of the long bones: two mummies died at the age of 4 years ± 12 months, the third one at the age of 6 years ± 24 months. Hyperdontia or polydontia, a dental anomaly, could also be identified in one child using 3D visualizations of the teeth: two supernumerary teeth were found behind the maxillary permanent central incisors which had not been noticed in the Dawson and Gray's X-ray analysis.

The charm of world citizenship had not only provided theoretical grounds of international collaborative research into the psychopathology of psychiatric diseases, but also gave birth to the international psychiatric epidemiologic studies conducted by the World Health Organization. Themes explored in this paper include the global awareness of mental rehabilitation, the application of public health methods in psychiatry to improve mental health globally, the attempt by the WHO to conduct large-scale, cross-cultural studies relevant to mental health and the initial problems it faced. © The Author(s) 2015.","Psychiatric epidemiology; social psychiatry; transcultural psychiatry; world citizenship; World Health Organization","history; human; international cooperation; medical research; Mental Disorders; mental health; organization; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychiatry; social psychiatry; warfare; world health organization; Biomedical Research; Combat Disorders; Community Psychiatry; Congresses as Topic; History, 20th Century; Humans; Internationality; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Psychiatry; Warfare; World Health Organization",,,0957154X,,,26022467,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930354775

In these two works Boyle wrestles with a difficult practical and philosophical problem with experiments, which he calls the problem of contingency. In Touching Colours, the problem of contingency is magnified by the much-debated issue of whether color had any deep epistemic importance. His limited theoretical principle guiding him in Touching Colours, that color is but modified light, further exacerbated the problem. Rather than theory, Boyle often relied on craftsmen, whose mastery of color phenomena was, Boyle mentions, brought about by economic forces, to determine when colors were indicators of important 'inward' properties of substances, and thus to secure a solid foundation for his experimental history of color. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","artisanal knowledge; Boyle, Touching Colours; colour worlds; craftsmen; history of experiment; philosophy of experiment; Robert Boyle","chemistry; color; England; history; Ireland; knowledge; Chemistry; Color; History, 17th Century; Ireland; Knowledge; London",,,13837427,,,26856050,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954145998

Background: The notion of nursing as therapy gained credence in the 1990s and is currently experiencing resurgence, as nurses seek to find meaning in their work and improve patient care in the post-Francis environment. Design: This discussion paper will use the hostile space of the desert war zone in World War II to explore nurses' therapeutic engagement with their combatant patients. It will examine how nurses provided care and comfort through the use of self, fundamental nursing skills, improvisation and innovation and the manipulation of the environment. Data sources: The data used are a combination of letters, diaries, memoirs and published archival material. Much of the personal testimony is part of an uncatalogued archive of correspondence between nurses and the Matron-in-Chief of the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service. Implications for nursing: Nurses sometimes struggle to identify the importance of their work, compared with other members of the multidisciplinary team. By understanding nursing as therapy, the profession can articulate how their work is fundamental to the healing, or support to a dignified death of their patients. This article illustrates how the therapeutic engagement with patients, even in the most difficult of environments, is possible and brings comfort. Conclusion: Deserts are among the most hostile of any space inhabited by people. Yet, even in a place where survival is difficult, therapeutic nursing can support healing and recovery. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","History of nursing; Nurses; Nursing theories; Nursing-practice; Therapeutic nursing; War nursing","adaptive behavior; desert climate; Great Britain; history; human; military nursing; nurse attitude; nurse patient relationship; nursing care; procedures; war; Adaptation, Psychological; Desert Climate; Great Britain; History, 19th Century; Humans; Military Nursing; Nurse's Role; Nurse-Patient Relations; Nursing Care; World War II",,,03092402,,JANUD,26201257,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942984830

This happens against the background of the current psychiatry-historical literature in which this phase of psychiatric care is described often summarily with the destructive words of the report of the 'Psychiatrie-Enquête' of 1975. Improvements achieved in this time were hardly examined up to now though they contributed substantially to the later effects of the 'Psychiatrie-Enquête'. Methods: The medical annual reports of the psychiatric clinic of Zwiefalten, today ZfP Südwürttemberg, refering to the mentioned period were sighted and evaluated concerning their contents. Results: In the called period evident organizational and structural defects are deplored in the annual reports. Nevertheless, from the late 1940s on, modern care elements appear, as for example the broadening of the range of the therapeutic offers, multiprofessional treatment, diagnosis-specific concepts for the wards, opening of stations and extensive outpatient care.

On the contrary, fatalities continue to decrease in high income countries. The aim of the study was to find evidence for changes in injury severity of passenger car occupants after road traffic accidents in Germany over time, and to find contributing factors. Methods Data from the German In Depth Accident Study (GIDAS), representative for Germany, was used. A total of 24.405 accidents, reported from 1991 until 2011. 44.503 adult passenger car occupants were examined. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to find reasons for observed trends over time. Results The relative decrease in mortality was 68.8% from 1991 until 2011. Between 2006 and 2011, the percentage of severely injured traffic victims was less than half, both in terms of the whole body and individual body regions. For injuries with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥2, the percentage of persons with lower leg injuries declined by 72.5%, followed by the percentage of persons with pelvic injuries (61.5%), upper extremity injuries (57.7%), head injuries (54.3%), thorax injuries (50.0%), and abdomen injuries (40.0%). The multivariable regression model found 13 independent variables associated with injury prevention (e.g. seat belt use: OR 0.41, CI 95% 0.32-0.49; airbag: OR 0.86, CI 95% 0.75-0.99). The implementation of protective factors increased over time while accident constellations with a high probability for severe injury decreased over time. Conclusion The decrease of severe injuries after road traffic accidents can be only attributed to a comprehensive approach including the enforcement of road safety policies and innovations in car engineering and emergency medicine. Traffic related measures and alcohol level control, and seat belt usage enforcement next to other technical advances are considered especially important. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

During the war, surgeons realized that it was not enough to merely treat the limbs of the wounded soldiers; it was also necessary to train them to use their remaining abilities to their greatest capacity. Governments at the same time realized that such a high number of veterans created a financial burden, by entitling disabled veterans to full healthcare, raising the issues of social welfare. Both in the US and Europe, programs of rehabilitation were instituted, providing injured soldiers with long-term medical care and vocational training aimed at restituting soldier's independence for a speedy return to work. In Italy at the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, one of the most renowned Hospitals for the treatment of orthopedic deformities, Putti set up a technologically advanced Orthopedic Workshop, and a Rehabilitation House. The so called ""reconstruction programs"" addressed all aspects of rehabilitation (including physiotherapy, curative workshops and vocational therapy), seeing disability in terms of function. The experience gained in the treatment of war victims markedly enriched rehabilitation techniques, but overall the First World War helped engender the concept of rehabilitative programs to assist disabled veterans reintegrate in the workplace, thus laying the foundations of the modern concept of participation at a social level. In the centenary of Italy's entry into the First World War, it is worth underlining just how much hindsight affords us a new perspective on Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. It reminds us that rehabilitation is not merely the role of medicine, but forms part of a multifaceted approach involving societal roles and expectations, regardless of the psychological and physical impairments suffered by the individuals concerned.","Disability-; Occupational therapy; Rehabilitation-; War-","disabled person; history; human; rehabilitation medicine; soldier; war; Disabled Persons; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Military Personnel; Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine; World War I",,,19739087,,,25941048,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84932088189

This disease originated from an ancient enzootic cycle, and human infection has been detected in 4,000- to 9,000-year-old mummies and has expanded with European colonization, reaching its peak prevalence in the 20th century. Discovered in 1909, the disease remained obscure and uncontrolled until the 1950s, when the generalization of serology, the characterization of chronic cardiomyopathy, and effective insecticides began. By the 1960s, national control programs were launched and incidence began to decrease as a result. During this time, scientific improvements became increasingly available to address disease management. Presently, challenges in managing Chagas disease include maintaining sustainable epidemiological surveillance, the spread of the disease to nonendemic countries, the apparent spread of oral transmission, and new symptoms and manifestations.

Urinary incontinence (UI) is involuntary leakage of urine. It is an undiagnosed, under-reported, and frequently untreated medical condition that greatlyaffects the quality of life of women in any age. Therefore, a literary search in classical literature of Greco-Arabic medicine for UI was explored to implement in current era. Material and Methods: Meticulous literature search was carried out to comprehend the concept of urinary incontinence described in ancient Unani literature. The classical Greco-Arabic medicine texts were searched. Further, browsing of PubMed/Google Scholar and other websites was carried by searching complementary and alternative treatment for urinary incontinence and herbal remedies useful in urinary incontinence. Results: The causes of urinary incontinence described in Greco-Arabic texts are abnormal temperament of body or bladder, dislocation of vertebrae, pregnancy, diuretic, laxity of musculature of bladder, diseases of surrounding structure such as uterine inflammation, omphalitis, constipation, etc. The principle treatment is treating the cause viz., the temperament is corrected by diet and herbs in abnormal temperament, and elimination of morbid humour is required in dominance of humour. Further, web search showed that herbs are useful in Urinary diseases. However, evidences are weak. Conclusion: The classical Greco-Arabic texts are enriched with important information. Thus documentation and preservation of the traditional knowledge is required so that it can still be conserved for future research in pharmaceuticals and drug discovery. © 2015, Croatian Scientific Society for the History of Health.

Half of PVSG/WHO-defined ET patients show low serum erythropoietin levels and carry the JAK2V617F mutation, indicating prodromal PV. The positive predictive value of a JAK2V617F PCR test is 95% for the diagnosis of PV, and about 50% for ET and MF. The WHO-defined JAK2V617F-positive ET comprises three ET phenotypes at clinical and bone marrow level when the integrated WHO and European Clinical, Molecular and Pathological (ECMP) criteria are applied: normocellular ET (WHO-ET), hypercellular ET due to increased erythropoiesis (prodromal PV) and hypercellular ET associated with megakaryocytic granulocytic myeloproliferation (EMGM). Four main molecular types of clonal MPN can be distinguished: JAK2V617F-positive ET and PV; JAK2 wild-type ET carrying the MPL515; mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene in JAK2/MPL wild-type ET and MF, and a small proportion of JAK2/MPL/CALR wild-type ET and MF patients. The JAK2V617F mutation load is low in heterozygous normocellular WHO-ET. The JAK2V617F mutation load in hetero-/homozygous PV and EMGM is clearly related to MPN disease burden in terms of splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms and fibrosis. The JAK2 wild-type ET carrying the MPL515 mutation is featured by clustered small and giant megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated stag-horn-like nuclei, in a normocellular bone marrow (WHO-ET), and lacks features of PV. JAK2/MPL wild-type, CALR mutated hypercellular ET associated with PMGM is featured by dense clustered large immature dysmorphic megakaryocytes and bulky (cloud-like) hyperchromatic nuclei, which are never seen in WHO-ECMP-defined JAK2V617F mutated ET, EMGM and PV, and neither in JAK2 wild-type ET carrying the MPL515 mutation. Two thirds of JAK2/MPL wild-type ET and MF patients carry one of the CALR mutations as the cause of the third distinct MPN entity.

Archaeological and historical evidence suggests that this major shift in the scale of conflict may have involved a reorganization of the military system, which changed from an elite militia to a conscript or standing army from the Orientalizing-Archaic (800-500 BC) to Hellenistic times (400-27 BC). We propose a bioarchaeological framework jointly analyzing skeletal properties and funerary treatment in male Samnites to investigate on this shift in military organization. We anticipated that, when Samnites had an elite militia, the warring force was constituted by the wealthier segments of the society. Conversely, we expected the warring force of the standing/conscript army to be mainly drawn from the lower social strata. We considered high asymmetry in J, a measure of humeral torsional rigidity (calculated via cross-sectional geometry, CSG) as a proxy for pre- and peri-adolescent-onset weapon training. The social standing of the individual was approximated via funerary treatment analysis (Status Index). Results show that in the Orientalizing-Archaic period, humeral asymmetry and Status Index are positively correlated, and the high-status subsample shows significantly higher asymmetry than the low-status subsample. Among Hellenistic Samnites, no correlation between Status Index and humeral asymmetry is present, and the low-status subsample is the most lateral-ized.

One current, pressing, issue is the role of the whistleblower, who recognises and exposes perceived poor practice or ethical transgressions that compromise patient care and safety. Once, whistleblowers were ostracised where medical culture closed ranks. However, in a new era of public accountability, medicine looks to formally embrace whistleblowing to the point that not reporting transgressions can now constitute a transgression of professionalism. Where medical students identify with the history and traditions of medical culture, they inevitably find themselves in situations of conflicting loyalties if they encounter senior clinicians behaving unprofessionally. What are the implications of facing these dilemmas for students in terms of role modelling and shaping of character as a doctor, and how might a study of Homer help with such dilemmas? We suggest that a close reading of an opening scene in Homer’s the Iliad can help us to better appreciate such ethical dilemmas. We link this with the early Greek tradition of parrhesia or ‘truth telling’, where frankly speaking out against perceived injustice is encouraged as resistance to power and inappropriate use of authority. We encourage medical educators to openly discuss perceived ethical dilemmas with medical students, and medicine as a culture to examine its conscience in a transition from an authoritarian to an ‘open’ society, where whistleblowing becomes as acceptable and necessary as good hygiene on the wards. © 2015 BMJ Publishing Group.

During the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (ca. 200 B.C.-ca. 200 A.D.) urbanization and population growth led to conditions favorable to the spread of tuberculosis throughout Italy and especially within Rome itself. Trade and military expansion would have acted as vehicles for the further extension of tuberculosis to the provinces via direct transmission from Italian-born Romans to the native populations. However, an alternative explanation may better explain the increase in the number of archeological cases of tuberculosis with the start of the Roman era. A literature review of Roman-era cases and their locations suggests that the development of an urban, Roman way of life resulted in significant increases in prevalence in regions where tuberculosis had previously been endemic only at a low level. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Largely inspired by John Turner's work in Peru in the 1960s with low-income communities, this volume assembles experience in diff erent countries and is strongly influenced by Turner's notion of 'housing as a verb'. This book heavily influenced my research in the Ivory Coast in 1969-1971 and later my work as a young economist in the World Bank starting in 1972. Turner's ideas became the theoretical basis for policies governing international urban assistance to developing countries in the form of 'sites and services' and 'slum upgrading', two approaches to improving urban shelter and infrastructure which became the dominant form of urban aid for the decades of the 1970s and 1980s. Projects of these types were financed in more than eighty countries and hundreds of cities and towns in this period, directly reflecting the insights of John Turner and the authors of the chapters in the Turner and Fichter volume. The legacy of this work has largely been unevaluated, either by professionals in these countries or in the international agencies.

Heritage zones promote conservation of historic resources and can incubate small businesses, revitalize commercial districts, generate local jobs and foster positive change in a community. The social benefits are many, yet long-term retention of the benefits requires deliberate planning. The prosperity brought by the tourists tends to destroy the experiences they seek. Heritage tourists seek experiences of authentic cultural heritage. Yet, the economic prosperity of tourism can swiftly alter a region. Business and real estate development pressures increase as the tourist market expands, bringing changes that occlude and displace the local heritage. This paper posits that attention to cultural sustainability can mitigate negative impacts and correlate to a robust heritage tourism economy. Sustainable development practices can support cultural heritage tourism in a manner that sustains the local culture. The San Antonio Missions and potential development in South San Antonio are reviewed here as an economic development tool designed to attract visitors to an area based on the unique aspects of the locality's history, landscape and culture. The heritage tourism market needs cultural heritage in order to grow and retain the economic prosperity over time. This research investigates and analyzes the potential of the San Antonio Missions Historic District toward community-based cultural heritage tourism. The connections of Missions to the river will feature historic and artistic interpretations of the story of the missions and highlight their social and cultural importance to the area. This will reinforce the importance of the river to the missions and encourage visitors to circulate between the Mission Reach and the river. Accelerating tourism in Missions Historic District will be a considerable economic and social benefit through the workforce, income and infrastructure developments. This research provides a legacy of positive development within the Missions Historic District, especially as San Antonio moves toward World Heritage designation. World Heritage designation brings international attention and increased tourism with both positive and negative impacts. Cultural heritage tourism can bring many benefits to a local economy but it can also disrupt the quality of life of the local inhabitants. This research also investigates how to prevent gentrification and the loss of authenticity while tourism in the district accelerates. This paper also promotes cultural and environmental sustainability at the local or neighborhood level, and highlights the potential benefits for small business owners to connect to the growing heritage tourism economy of the San Antonio Missions Historic District. Prosperity for residents of the district is a viable path to sustaining the community's cultural heritage, identity and authenticity.","architectural conservation; architectural icon; artificial neural network; artificial neural network; Aspect ratio; Authenticity; Biological mechanical treatment; bottom sediments; Brazilian architecture; Brisbane; British colonial architecture; Carbon formation; catalysis; catalytically active nanolayer; climate change; Combined heat and power plant; community-based design; cultural heritage tourism; demand-supply framework; domestic space; environmental impact mitigation; exhaust gas composition; factor analysis; flood; flow resistance; forecast; fuel consumption; fuzzy inference system; gasification; Heritage architecture; Ile-Ife; influencing factors; innovative gas appliances; IPO; lagged climate indices; management; meandering channel; model independence; Moscow urban rivers; municipal solid waste; Niño 3.4; PAH identification; perception of space; producer services; Rainfall; Rainfall; refuse derived fuel; respirometry; selective collection; sinuosity; SOI; solid recovery fuel; sustainability; sustainable tourist accommodation; tourism potential of heritage architecture; traditional Nigerian architecture; World Heritage designation","Aspect ratio; Catalysis; Climate change; Climate models; Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Domestic appliances; Economics; Environmental impact; Factor analysis; Floods; Forecasting; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Fuzzy inference; Gas fuel analysis; Gasification; Heat resistance; Historic preservation; History; Management; Municipal solid waste; Network architecture; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Rain; Refuse collection; Refuse derived fuels; Regional planning; Rivers; Sustainable development; Waste management; Waste treatment; architectural icon; Authenticity; Bottom sediments; Brisbane; Carbon Formation; Climate index; Combined heat and power plants; Community-based; Cultural heritages; Demand supplies; domestic space; Exhaust Gas Composition; Flow resistance; Fuzzy inference systems; Heritage architectures; Ile-ife; influencing factors; IPO; Meandering channel; Mechanical treatments; Nano layers; Nigerians; Producer services; Respirometry; sinuosity; SOI; Tourist accommodations; Urban river; World Heritage designation; Economic and social effects; business development; cost-benefit analysis; cultural heritage; ecotourism; heritage tourism; neighborhood; quality of life; tourism development; tourism market; World Heritage Site; San Antonio; Texas; United States",,,17437601,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929625850

Yet, he made numerous other seminal and clinically relevant discoveries. Namely, since he had a focused research on steroid hormones originating from the adrenal cortex that play a crucial role in stress response, he was the fi rst who introduced about 70 years ago the fi rst classification of steroids that is still valid nowadays. This is based on three objective facts: (a) the names of steroid groups are identical with their organ of origin (e.g., corticoids from the adrenal cortex, testoids/androgens from the testis); (b) chemical structures of the steroids are identical within a group (e.g., all corticoids have pregnane nucleus with 21 carbon atoms); and (c) the biological effects are homogenous within a group (e.g., all glucocorticoids exert catabolic effect, while androgens are anabolic). It should be emphasized that Selye also discovered in animal models the pro-inflammmatory effect of mineralocorticoids and the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids, about 8-10 years before Nobel Prize was awarded to a physician for the first clinical use of adrenocorticotrop hormone and cortisone. Last, but not least, Selye was the first who recognized about 70 years ago the occurence of stress ulcers in humans, based on clinical reports on the huge increase in the number of perforated gastric anti-duodenal ulcers during bombings of London in World War II.

We present a new memory graph representation, MG++, and a memory graph construction algorithm, that greatly enhance the utility of memory graphs. First, in addition to capturing the shapes of dynamically-constructed data structures, MG++ also captures how they evolve as the program executes and records the source code statements that play a role in their evolution to assist in debugging. Second, MG++ captures the history of actions performed by the memory allocator. This is useful in debugging programs that internally manage storage or in cases where understanding program behavior requires examining memory allocator actions. Our binary instrumentation-based algorithm for MG++ construction does not rely on the knowledge of memory allocator functions or on symbol table information. Our algorithm works for custom memory allocators as well as for in-program memory management. Experiments studying the time and space efficiency for real-world programs show that MG++ representation is space-efficient and the time overhead for MG++ construction algorithm is practical. We show that MG++ is effective for fault location and for analyzing binaries to detect heap buffer overflow attacks. © 2015 IEEE.","buffer overflow attacks; evolution history; fault location; memory allocator history; memory graph","Algorithms; Buffer storage; Data structures; Digital storage; Electric fault location; Binary instrumentations; Buffer overflow attacks; Construction algorithms; Dynamic data structure; Evolution history; Graph representation; Memory allocators; Real world projects; Program debugging",,,,9781479984695,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928668020

Its strategic military value was immediately recognised by the Allies, and mass production was undertaken with the prime objective of meeting the needs of the armed forces. News of its development came to be widely reported on in the media and is examined here. These reports frequently combined accounts of penicillin's prodigious clinical effectiveness with the fact that it was to remain unavailable to the civilian population essentially until the war had ended. More penicillin was to be made available to the civilian population in the United States than in Britain, but the sense that it was severely rationed remained as high. It was in response to this that the idea of ""homemade penicillin"" was hatched. News of this was also widely promulgated by both the British and American media. Although the numbers treated with penicillin produced in this way was never to be significant, knowledge of the existence of such endeavours may have served to assuage in some measure the feelings of frustration felt by the civilian population at penicillin's non-availability.","Homemade penicillin; Penicillin; Press reports; Radio broadcasts; Vivicillin; World War II","antiinfective agent; penicillin derivative; attitude to health; history; human; mass medium; public opinion; supply and distribution; United Kingdom; United States; war; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Attitude to Health; Communications Media; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Penicillins; Public Opinion; United States; World War II",,,02119536,,,26012339,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925656158

It reveals that the Japanese government maintained this wide-ranging promotion system since its establishment during the war until well into the postwar period. Previous studies insist that, at the end of the war, the Japanese government generally only funded the research that it considered immediately and practically useful. In contrast to this general perception, my analysis illustrates that both before and after the war, funding was allotted to four research areas: natural science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine. In order to illuminate this continuity, I compare the Subsidiary Fund with another research fund existing from 1933 to 1947: the Grant of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS). The comparison demonstrates that the JSPS received externally raised capital from the military and munitions companies. However, while this group focused upon engineering and military-related research as the war dragged on, the Subsidiary Fund has consistently entrusted scientists with the authority to decide the allocation of financial support.",,"agriculture; economics; engineering; financial management; health care organization; history; Japan; military phenomena; natural science; war; Agriculture; Engineering; Financing, Government; History, 20th Century; Japan; Military Science; Natural Science Disciplines; Societies, Scientific; World War II",,,00227692,,,27209652,"Japanese",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979831190

This article explores the attitude of the occupiers towards prostitution and venereal disease, among the indigenous population as well as among their own soldiers, officers and female support staff. The measures taken were primarily guided by military considerations. For the military, the occupied areas were zones that served particular purposes, such as preserving peace and order behind the front, making use of manpower and resources, and serving as cordon sanitaire. In spite of this, pseudo-peace-like structures evolved in the capitals Belgrade and Cetinje that facilitated the spread of prostitution and venereal disease. In my article, I will look at the scale of the debate and of the proposed countermeasures. It is noticeable that women were usually branded as the perpetrators, while the soldiers were seen as the ones in need of protection. In spite of this, it is apparent how candidly the royal-imperial army dealt with the topic even though it went against the current ideas of morality. The social differentiation that was customary in the imperial and royal army applied here, too. Officers suffering from venereal disease had their own hospitals and brothels and were permitted leave more often (a fact that went against the purpose of these institutions). The topic also received publicity because the military physicians, who were in fact civilians mobilized by the army, chose to publish continuously on the topic. Based on the microcosm of occupied enemy territory, my contribution shows how ideas of morality changed during the war despite traditional gender stereotypes, and the role played by the military in these developments.",,"history; war; History, 20th Century; World War I",,,0939351X,,,26137642,"German",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940051243

They argued that the inner workings of the body were ultimately unknowable, existing beyond the limits of human knowledge and inference. Yet they insisted that medical certainty was still possible, claiming that every disease shared one of three directly apprehensible “manifest commonalities”—stricture, laxity, or some mixture of the two. Medicine could therefore be a science; it was simply noncausal in structure. This essay examines these medical theories in light of Herbert Simon’s concept of “bounded rationality,” suggesting that the Methodists were proposing a type of medical “heuristic” in response to the limitations of human knowledge and processing power. At the same time, the essay suggests that such an epistemology had its consequences, setting up an ontological crunch whereby the demands formerly placed on diseases and their causes transferred to “affections” and the commonalities, with successive generations of Methodists disagreeing about the status of symptoms, signs, and diseased states. Borrowing vocabulary from the Methodists themselves, the essay calls the consequent ontological slippage between causes and effects “metalepsis.” © 2015 by The History of Science Society.

Our analysis indicates that different cities have been prominent in different periods and that population numbers, economic figures and mutual interconnectedness among the various cities within the GPRD through various urban infrastructures, but also with regard to production and R&D have grown to such an extent that it can indeed be qualified as a global city-region as defined by Allen Scott (2001), with global city Hong Kong acting as a hinge to the global market. Currently and in the future, the GPRD is the most poly-centric global city-region in the world, although it also appears that its political fragmentation has acted as a barrier to vigorous further development since economic indicators show a relative decline compared to the Yangtze River Delta. © 2014 The Society of Urban Technology.","global city-region; Greater Pearl River Delta (GPRD); historical trajectory; Pearl River Delta (PRD)","historical perspective; planning history; urban development; urban history; urban politics; world city; China; Guangdong; Hong Kong; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",,,10630732,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938287466

This article takes its cue from the original work of sir Alexander Fleming on penicillin, published in the first issue of Recenti Progressi in Medicina in 1946 and reproduced here on the occasion of the approaching 70-year anniversary of the journal. The path that brought Fleming to the discovery of penicillin, one of the major milestones in the history of clinical pharmacology, provides insight for a range of considerations: the painstaking efforts of researchers, the contribution from accidental findings, and the dissemination of study results. Although the discovery of penicillin has changed the course of medicine, the benefits deriving from such an important advance are most likely to be offset by the overprescription of antibiotics, which is the leading cause of antimicrobial resistance and one of the most serious public health problems of our time.",,"antibiotic agent; penicillin derivative; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; Article; clinical pharmacology; incidental finding; information dissemination; prescription; growth, development and aging; history; human; mass communication; metabolism; Penicillium chrysogenum; war; wound infection; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Diffusion of Innovation; History, 20th Century; Humans; Incidental Findings; Penicillins; Penicillium chrysogenum; World War I; Wound Infection",,,00341193,,RPMDA,26076415,"Italian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936758623

In contrast to prevailing concerns during the interwar decades about sexual dissatisfaction as the chief impediment to marital stability, post-WWII marriage counselors and therapists framed marital harmony as dependent upon spouses' psychological maturity. An inability to sustain a stable marriage was interpreted as a sign of arrested development, most often stemming from a dysfunctional relationship with one or both parents in childhood. This essay reveals that the equalbut- different gender roles that were the cornerstone of the modern ""companionate"" marriage were crucial to marital counselors and therapists' psychological understanding of marriage as an interpersonal relationship during the decades following WWII. Practitioners gauged therapeutic success not only in accordance with whether or not couples stayed married, but also in terms of the extent to which spouses enthusiastically accepted the adult masculine and feminine spousal roles that the male-breadwinning nuclear family required. Moreover, therapists' valuing of the emotional dimensions of marriage made ""natural"" feminine attributes-such as a presumed ease in establishing loving relationships-a centrally valued aspect of therapeutic work and intimate life more broadly. Far from having a potentially disruptive impact on the presumed naturalness of gender difference (which had been a focus of criticism of psychoanalysis during the interwar decades), the psychoanalytic techniques that were developed to treat marriage problems after WWII were profoundly normalizing. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Gender and the nuclear family; Marriage therapy; Married couple as the unit of treatment; Post-WWII Britain","attitude; emotion; female; feminism; gender identity; history; human; marital therapy; marriage; psychology; United Kingdom; war; Attitude; Emotions; Female; Feminism; Gender Identity; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Marital Therapy; Marriage; Psychology; World War II",,,10934510,,,26375155,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938938326

Between October 1914 and December 1915, these soldiers fought at the battles of Ypres, Festubert, Givenchy, Neuve Chapelle, Second Ypres, and Loos, suffering some 34,252 casualties. This article looks to the experiences of these men at segregated hospitals in France and England from 1914 to 1915. These hospitals served many of the same dual purposes facilitated by hospitals for English soldiers: namely, they sustained the war-making capacity of the Indian battalions. The Indian hospitals also functioned as sites of propaganda, reaffirming the ideologies and racial hierarchies of imperial rule for audiences at home, abroad, and within the hospital wards. But as this article demonstrates, wounded Indian sepoys were rarely, if ever, mere pawns on the imperial chessboard. Hospital authorities were committed to two policies: returning sepoys to the front and protecting White prestige. Sepoys successfully resisted both. In so doing, Indian hospitals became what British hospital administrators hoped they would not: spaces where imperial subjects contested and even reshaped some of the policies and ideologies of imperial rule. © The Author [2015].",,"female; France; history; human; India; male; political system; politics; public hospital; racism; soldier; United Kingdom; war; Colonialism; Female; France; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Hospitals, Military; Humans; India; Male; Military Personnel; Politics; Racism; World War I",,,09552359,,,26502664,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945253758

In contrast, low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have participated minimally in genomic research for several reasons including the lack of coherent national policies, the limited number of well-trained genomic scientists, poor research infrastructure, and local economic and cultural challenges. Recent initiatives such as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa), the Qatar Genome Project, and the Mexico National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) that aim to address these problems through capacity building and empowerment of local researchers have sparked a paradigm shift. In this short communication, we describe experiences of small-scale medical genetics and translational genomic research programs in LMIC. The lessons drawn from these programs drive home the importance of addressing resource, policy, and sociocultural dynamics to realize the promise of precision medicine driven by genomic science globally. By echoing lessons from a bench-to-community translational genomic research, we advocate that large-scale genomic research projects can be successfully linked with health care programs. To harness the benefits of genomics-led health care, LMIC governments should begin to develop national genomics policies that will address human and technology capacity development within the context of their national economic and sociocultural uniqueness. These policies should encourage international collaboration and promote the link between the public health program and genomics researchers. Finally, we highlight the potential catalytic roles of the global community to foster translational genomics in LMIC. © 2015 S.

He was one of the first physicians to systematically record blood pressure, heart rate and haemoglobin level. The anaesthetic techniques of the time resulted in deep hypotension and high mortality. Marshall's main achievement was his design of a machine which could be used to reliably administer a mixture of ether, oxygen and nitrous oxide.

However, as this article discusses, recessions did not always boost cartelisation; sometimes they hindered it. This article explores for the first time the Swedish-Finnish timber export cartel between 1918 and 1921, and sketches out why the cartel worked best during rising demand and why the recession of 1921 killed it. The article is based on primary sources in the Swedish and Finnish archives. Research on cartel timing is used as the main theoretical framework in interpreting the material. Besides discussing how the direction of demand affected the dynamics in the Swedish-Finnish timber cartel, this article also analyses the roles that the governments and central banks played in the rise and fall of the cartel.

By examining an oft- neglected 1950 film, The Men, along with medical, personal, and popular accounts of impotence in paralyzed World War II veterans, this essay excavates the contours of that change and its attendant anxieties. While previous scholarship on film and sexuality in the postwar period has focused on women’s experiences, we broaden the analytical lens to provide a fuller picture of the various meanings of male sexuality, especially disabled heterosexuality. In postwar America, the paralyzed veteran created a temporary fissure in conventional discussions of the gendered body, a moment when the “normality” and performative features of the male body could not be assumed but rather had to be actively defined. To many veterans, and to the medical men who treated them, sexual reproduction—not function—became the ultimate signifier of remasculinization. © 2015 by The History of Science Society.

The relationship between cultural heritage charters and how authenticity has been employed in them is explored with examples from the Athen's Charter, The Venice Charter, The Nara Document, The San Antonio Declaration, and the UNESCO World Heritage Documents. Several examples are discussed in the text concerning the interactions between authenticity and restoration, employing the examples of ancient buildings and old master paintings. Some of the important writings on the subject of authenticity by scholars and art historians are reviewed. Criteria which could be used to evaluate the concept of authenticity in different cultural settings are discussed and these are illustrated with case studies taken from restoration carried out on ancient marble sculptures, the Sistine Chapel frescoes by Michelangelo, and the artwork of several prominent forgers. Given that concerns about the authenticity of art are multi-dimensional, it is important that the present fragmentation of the arguments concerning authenticity across the disciplines properly take into account the conservation field and are aware of the debates within conservation concerning this topic. The questioning of the relevance of authenticity is a healthy process, and may now be framed quite differently from the way in which it was discussed even 20 years ago. © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2015.","Art history; Authenticity; Conservation charters; Restoration","Image reconstruction; Restoration; Ancient buildings; Art history; Authenticity; Cultural heritages; Cultural settings; Marble sculptures; Old master paintings; UNESCO world heritages; History",,,00393630,,SCONA,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931066242

It has been put together using archives held by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (before its Royal Charter, the NIB) and Blind Veterans UK (formerly St. Dunstan's), the two organizations responsible for Britain's Talking Book Service. The essay's first section reconstructs the search for an alternative way of reading that would benefit people with vision impairments. The next part demonstrates the talking book's impact on the lives of people with disabilities, recovering the voices of blind readers left out of most histories of books, literacy, and reading practices in the twentieth century. The final section reconstructs a debate over the value of recorded books, showing that disputes over their legitimacy are as old as recorded books themselves.

We demonstrate robust cache attacks at the browser, operating system and Web proxy level. Private browsing sessions, HTTPS and corporate intranets are vulnerable. Through case studies of (1) anti-phishing protection in online banking, (2) Web search using the address bar in browsers, (3) publishing of personal images in social media, and (4) use of desktop search, we show that CTAs can seriously compromise privacy and security of individuals and organisations.

This article focuses on a key strategy for erasing the scars of war, one with ostensibly unambiguous benefit for the disabled themselves: the development of prostheses. In addition to fostering independence from others and ultimately from the state, artificial limbs would facilitate the veterans’ return to the kinds of socially useful labor by which the country defined itself.

After a brief discussion of the early history of the WHO and its position in Cold War politics, the essay considers the WHO program in radiation protection and heredity and how the genetic study of «vanishing» human populations and a world-wide genetic study of newborns fitted this broader agenda. It then considers in more detail the kind of support offered by the WHO for these projects.

Focusing on frailty and mortality risk, we investigated how these differed by age, sex, and status, using coffin type as a proxy for social status. We employed skeletal data from 344 individuals: 150 rural and 194 urban (1st-5th centuries A.D.) from Dorset, England. Frailty and mortality risk were examined using indicators of stress (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, nonspecific periostitis, and enamel hypoplastic defects), specific metabolic and infectious diseases (rickets, scurvy, and tuberculosis), and dental health (carious lesions and calculus). These variables were studied using Chi-square, Siler model of mortality, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the Gompertz model of adult mortality. Our study found that overall, mortality risk and survivorship did not differ between cemetery types but when the data were examined by age, mortality risk was only significantly higher for urban subadults. Demographic differences were found, with urban cemeteries having more 0-10 and >35 year olds, and for health, urban cemeteries had significantly higher frequencies of enamel hypoplastic defects, carious lesions, and rickets. Interestingly, no significant difference in status was observed between rural and urban cemeteries. The most significant finding was the influence of the skeletal and funerary data from the Poundbury sites, which had different demographic profiles, significantly higher frequencies of the indicators of stress and dental health variables.

The term global health emergency has since evolved and most recently, the term & Public Health Emergency of International Concern& (as defined by the International Health Regulations in 2005) was applied to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which has caused over 11000 deaths [2]. Ebola control efforts are now focussed on getting to zero cases. Yet, while huge public interest has focussed on Ebola, TB is bereft of public attention despite causing 1.5 million deaths since the Ebola epidemic began a year ago. The WHO End TB strategy boldly aims to end the global TB epidemic by 2035 and envisions zero deaths, disease and suffering [3]. TB elimination is not a new concept but national preparedness plans are currently inadequate [4]. Although the epidemic trajectory of an emerging disease such as Ebola differs from that of a chronic pandemic such as TB, the implications of delayed recognition, poor infection control and pressing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges provide many parallels between the two infections. Thus, TB control efforts could learn valuable lessons from the recent experiences gained during response to the Ebola outbreak. © ERS 2015.",,"Article; diagnostic test; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebolavirus; epidemic; health care personnel; health care system; human; infection control; pandemic; priority journal; resource allocation; sensitivity and specificity; socioeconomics; tuberculosis; tuberculosis control; urbanization; world health organization; Africa; emergency; health; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; history; social stigma; tuberculosis; Africa, Western; Disease Outbreaks; Emergencies; Global Health; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; History, 21st Century; Humans; Social Stigma; Tuberculosis; World Health Organization",,,09031936,,ERJOE,26232473,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938856165

This included ideas on phrenology and craniometry, biological and psycho-social causes, physical and drug treatments, many of which travelled to India. Simultaneously, indigenous socio-medical ideas were being debated. From the early to the mid-nineteenth century, not much distinction was made between the Western and the native ‘mind’, and consequently the diagnosis and investigation of mental symptoms did not differ. However, by the late nineteenth century Western medicine considered the ‘Western mind’ as more civilized and sophisticated than the ‘native mind. © The Author(s) 2014.","19th century; Biomedical approach; colonial medicine; history; India; psychological ideas","Ayurveda; history; human; India; Mental Disorders; psychology; Western world; History, 19th Century; Humans; India; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mental Disorders; Psychology; Western World","WT096493MA, Wellcome Trust",,0957154X,,,25698688,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923339269

Methods: Death records for soldiers in the CEF who died in Canada in 1917 and 1918 were extracted from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and record-linked to the Canada War Graves Registers, Circumstances of Casualty database. Monthly mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I) were compared with mortality rates from all other causes for 1917 and 1918, and by region for 1918. Results: The herald wave of influenza was present among CEF soldiers in 1918. P&I mortality was significantly higher in March and April 1918 than during the same period in 1917. P&I mortality rates varied across the country and were significantly higher among soldiers who died in the Maritime region of Canada. In March, Maritime P&I mortality was significantly higher than its counterpart in the West; in April it was significantly higher than P&I mortality in both the Central and Western regions. Conclusions: The CEF findings suggest that local, geographic heterogeneity characterized the first wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Canada and illustrate the ways in which well-established, historical patterns of cross-border social contact with the United States, coupled with the special conditions created by warfare, disproportionately funnelled influenza into particular regions. Identification of the mild first wave among soldiers in the CEF calls for more research on the civilian experience of both waves of influenza in Canada. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Canada; female; history; human; Influenza, Human; male; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; pneumonia; soldier; very elderly; war; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Female; History, 20th Century; Humans; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Pandemics; Pneumonia; World War I; Young Adult",,,10420533,,AJHUE,25820782,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938960857

By 1914, UAC had struggled with few exceptions to adopt new technologies and processes and was still reliant on the Leblanc process. From 1914, the Government would rely heavily on its contribution to the war effort. As a major heavy-chemical manufacturer, UAC produced chemicals for explosives and warfare gases, while also trying to maintain production of many essential chemicals including fertilisers for homeland consumption. UAC's wartime effort was led by the Central Laboratory, working closely with the recently established Engineer's Department to develop new process pathways, build new plant, adapt existing plant, and produce the contracted quantities, all as quickly as possible to meet the changing battlefield demands. This article explores how wartime conditions and demands provided the stimulus for the Central Laboratory's crucial R&D work during World War One. © Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry 2015.",,"chemical industry; history; laboratory; war; Chemical Industry; History, 20th Century; Laboratories; World War I",,,00026980,,,26173343,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921991630

The reliefs present an astronomical ancestral picture gallery, running from the Patriarchs of the Old Testament to Copernicus. The author argues that the ""storyboard"" for this sequence of images must have been conceived down to its smallest details by the Kassel court astronomer Christoph Rothmann; indeed, many of the scenes shown, along with many particular details depicted within them, are literally described in Rothmann's never-published manuscript Observationes stellarum fixarum of 1589. The final section of the essay compares these reliefs to the images created for Tycho Brahe at his Uraniborg and Stjerneborg observatories. The author concludes that the sequence of the reliefs in Kassel, culminating in the representation of Copernicus and his world view, is a reflection of the acrimonious debate extending over many years between the heliocentrist Rothmann and the geo-heliocentrist Brahe regarding the veracity of the heliocentric world view. © koninklijke Brill Nv, Leiden 2015.","images of ancient astronomers; Kassel observatory; reception of the Copernican world view","art; astronomy; devices; Germany; history; Art; Astronomy; Germany; History, 16th Century",,,03947394,,,26495584,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923860180

Drawing on the notifications of communicable diseases collated by the General Register Office (GRO), we establish pre-war (baseline) disease rates for the 1470 districts. For the war years, techniques of binary logistic regression analysis are used to assess the associations between (a) above-baseline ('raised') disease rates in evacuation, neutral and reception districts and (b) the major phases of the evacuation scheme. The analysis demonstrates that the evacuation was temporally associated with distinct national and regional effects on notified levels of disease activity. These effects were most pronounced in the early years of the dispersal (1939-1941) and corresponded with initial levels of evacuation-related population change at the regional and district scales.

This historical study provides a biography of Paula Lind Ayers (1891-1974), a vocalist, actress, and YMCA Entertainer who became known as ""the girl who could sing away shell shock."" Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe Paula Lind Ayers' respite services during World War I and provide a contextual biography of her life. Methods: The author conducted an exhaustive search regarding Paula Lind Ayers' life and her activities during World War I. Numerous databases were used to locate print sources. Libraries, archives, and organizations were consulted to obtain unpublished primary sources. The author evaluated materials via a recursive process that included corroborating evidence, assessing source reliability, and contextualizing information. Data were synthesized and analyzed for emergent themes. Results: Findings suggest that Paula Lind Ayers developed a systematic approach using familiar, live singing that was effective in alleviating symptoms of shell shock. Her method was replicated by others overseas during World War I. After the war, she returned to a successful performance career until the Great Depression. No information was found about Ayers' life from the year 1929 until her death in 1974. Conclusions: Understanding Paula Lind Ayers' contribution to music therapy provides a deeper awareness of past therapeutic uses of music with soldiers who experienced shell shock. Such understanding helps shape the way we view the present conception of music therapy with veterans and how we might answer questions that will affect the future of the field. © the American Music Therapy Association 2014.

Research on psychosocial consequences of growing up as a GOC has been missing so far.

Findings have then been compared with a representative birth cohortâ€""matched sample fromthe German general population (N = 977). German occupation children showed significantly higher prevalence rates of most traumatic experiences, higher point prevalence rates of full and partial posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and somatization than the control group. In summary, GOC often grew up under difficult conditions (e.g., poverty, single mothers, and stigmatization). Even decades later, they showed higher rates of different mental disorders and higher comorbidity. These findings underline the complex and long-term impact of their burdened social, financial, and familial conditions.

The Presocratic - mainly Empedoclean - notions of 'mixing' and 'separation' lurk behind the Hippocratic treatise De genitura/De natura pueri, in which the process of generation is explained through the 'mixing' mechanism of a female semen and a male one. Semen comes from each part of both parents, so it is sound from the sound parts, and unhealthy from the unhealthy parts. It is considered as the ""foam of blood"" (Diogenes, A 24 DK), gathering itself into a web of blood vessels that bring it to the genital organs. The mixed semen keeps on fixing itself in the womb thanks to pneuma ('breath'), until the embryo takes human shape. Generation is influenced by both the environment (Airs, Waters, Places) and dietetics (On Regimen, I). Male and female are on different levels in CH, since the former is characterized as hot and strong, and the latter is considered as cold and weak; as a consequence of this, the articulation takes longer in the case of a female embryo. On the other hand, the pangenesis and the preformism theory claim for a strong mutual relationship. Sex determination depends from the 'prevalence' of the male or female semen. The generation of twins of different sex depends from such 'prevalence', as well as from the conformation of the womb and its places (right/male, left/female). Both nature (physis) and use (nomos) have a role in the mechanism of inheritance, as the case of the Macrocephalians in Airs Waters Places shows. On the other hand, Plato's Timaeus exemplifies the theory according to which semen derives from the spinal marrow. The structures of the body - bones, flesh, nerves - aim at protecting marrow itself for the sake of maintaining the continuity of the process of generation. For Aristotle, the female provides a specific contribution to generation, that is menstrual blood, the 'material' that will be fashioned into shape by the 'principle of movement' provided in the male semen. Menstrual blood and semen share the same nature, for they are both the ultimate secretion of nutriment, that is the residue of concocted blood. Considering the female as colder that the male, Aristotle develops the concept of the female as privation in relation to the male. The notion of 'prevalence' in its turn provides explanation for similarities between parents and children. The theory of a double semen originating itself in blood comes back again in Galen's treatise On semen, which links together the Hippocratic notion of a bi-sexual semen and the Aristotelian one of a specific female contribution, the menstrual blood, that provides nutrition for the embryo. Furthermore, similarities between sons and mothers are considered in Definitiones medicae as the main proof of the existence of a female semen. Actually the Alexandrian physicians - Herophilus for instance - considered the female sexual organs anatomy as perfectly corresponding to the male one. As a consequence of the synthesis between the Hippocratic and the Aristotelian tradition, Galen's embryological doctrines were very long-lasting in medical thought.",,"cultural anthropology; female; genetics; heredity; history; human; male; reproduction; Female; Genetics; Greek World; Heredity; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Reproduction",,,03949001,,,27348995,"Italian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979586891

In the Spanish American War, these efforts were primarily focused on tropical diseases. World War I problems that could be addressed by pathology and laboratory medicine were strikingly different because of the new field of clinical pathology. Geographic differences, changing war tactics, and trench warfare created new issues. Objectives. - To describe the scope of pathology and laboratory medicine services in World War I and the value these services brought to the war effort. Methods. - Available primary and secondary sources related to American Expeditionary Forces' laboratory services were analyzed and contrasted with the British and German approaches. Results. - The United States entered the war in April 1917. Colonel Joseph Siler, MD, a career medical officer, was the director, and Colonel Louis B. Wilson, MD, head of pathology at the Mayo Clinic, was appointed assistant director of the US Army Medical Corps Division of Laboratories and Infectious Disease, based in Dijon, France. During the next year, they organized 300 efficient laboratories to support the American Expeditionary Forces. Autopsies were performed to better understand treatment of battlefield injuries, effects of chemical warfare agents, and the influenza pandemic; autopsies also generated teaching specimens for the US Army Medical Museum. Bacteriology services focused on communicable diseases. Laboratory testing for social diseases was very aggressive. Significant advances in blood transfusion techniques, which allowed brief blood storage, occurred during the war but were not primarily overseen by laboratory services. Conclusions. - Both Siler and Wilson received Distinguished Service Medals. Wilson's vision for military pathology services helped transform American civilian laboratory services in the 1920s.",,"art; blood transfusion; chemical warfare; history; human; laboratory; male; military medicine; pathology; soldier; Spanish influenza; United States; war; Blood Transfusion; Chemical Warfare; History, 20th Century; Humans; Influenza Pandemic, 1918-1919; Laboratories; Male; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; Pathology, Clinical; United States; World War I",,,00039985,,ARPAA,26317455,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941645470

Throughout the essay, Goody focuses on the similarities existing in all Eurasian cultures to turn much of European history and historiography on its head. The essay documents the unity across Eurasia as an interconnected landmass, the legacies of the common Bronze Age of the Ancient Near East, its associated plough agriculture, and the traditions of writing and use of metals in order to reassess the primacy of material resource endowments in shaping human history. Goody presents a series of characteristics conventionally cited in the West as evidence of the uniqueness of Europe and shows that, in each and every case, equivalents can be found in Asia, and notably in China. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Age of Metals; Capitalism; Eurasia; Industrial Revolution; World History",,,,02757206,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938208816

Methods: All eligible permanent residents aged ≥ 35 years in selected rural villages of Liaoning province were invited to participate in the study. A total of 11 600 people completed all questionnaires and were included in the study. The response rate was 85.3%. Fasting plasma glucose levels were measured after at least 12 h of fasting and diabetes was diagnosed according to WHO criteria, i.e. fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/l and/or being on treatment for diabetes. Impaired fasting glucose was defined according to the 1997 and the 2010 American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (6.1-6.9 and 5.6-6.9 mmol/l, respectively). Previous diagnoses of diabetes were assessed on the basis of self-reports. Results: The prevalence of diabetes among adults in the rural population was 10.6% (10.0% in men and 11.1% in women). The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose was 13.0 and 36.1% according to the 1997 and the 2010 ADA criteria, respectively. The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes was 4.3% among the whole population (3.3% in men and 5.1% in women). The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes was 34.8% in men and 50.2% in women. Only 29.6% of men and 42% of women with diabetes had taken oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin to lower their blood sugar. In multivariate analysis, age, drinking habits, BMI, dyslipidaemia and family history of diabetes were identified as independent risk factors for diabetes, and occupational physical activity, smoking and lean meat intake were identified as independent protective factors for diabetes. Conclusions: The prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose were found to be high in this rural population. Although the rate of treatment of people with diabetes has increased, the glycaemic control rate was still at a low level. © 2014 Diabetes UK.",,"glucose; insulin; oral antidiabetic agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; age; aged; Article; awareness; body mass; China; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; diet restriction; drinking behavior; dyslipidemia; family history; female; food intake; glucose blood level; high risk population; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin treatment; lean meat; major clinical study; male; meat; medical society; middle aged; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; residential home; risk factor; rural population; self report; smoking habit; world health organization; awareness; diabetes mellitus; health survey; multivariate analysis; psychology; rural population; Aged; Awareness; China; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Health Surveys; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; World Health Organization",,,07423071,,DIMEE,25308779,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922544727

The incidence of breast cancer is lower, more common in younger age and a significant proportion of cases occur in premenopausal women. The aims of this study are to estimate the age-standardized incidence rate, age-specific rates and their comparison with some countries of Middle-East and West, and clarify the association of family history and premenopausal status with breast cancer. Materials and methods: This retrospective case control study was conducted in Sulaimanyah governorate (North of Iraq). Data were collected regarding demographical profile of 536 patients who were registered in Hewa Hematology and Oncology Hospital during 2011-2013, and 496 age-matched controls. Results: There were 536 cases of breast cancer, 526 of them were female. The age range was 20-82 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 49.42±11.66 years compared to control 46.7±10.2 (p[U+02C2]0.001, 95% CI: 1.7-3.7). The age-standardized rate was 17.9/100,000 Kurdish women population/year. Five year age-specific rates show the peak incidence for the age group 45-49 years (79.3/100,000). A significant percentage of patients were premenopausal at the time of diagnosis, which is account 55.52% of cases compared to control 59.67% (p=0.53). About 13.49% of cases have family history of breast cancer compared to control 3.2% (p=0.02). Conclusion: Among Kurdish people in Iraq, the incidence of breast cancer is less than Middle-East and Western countries with higher incidence in younger age group than western society, but similar to Middle-East countries.

He wrote a number of theological works in Latin and in Dutch. Most of his works have a polemical character, defending his orthodox protestant stance against a variety of heretical views. In De conversione Indorum et gentilium, based on disputations with students and published posthumously, he enters into a discussion with the 'heathens'. To this end he carefully combines biblical and classical scholarship and also reflects on the latest ethnographical information collected by both Protestant and Catholic travellers and missionaries. The book is characterised by great erudition and by an openness for other people's opinions that necessitates the constant appraisal of one's own point of view. We argue that such an open engagement with heretical views ultimately carries the danger of a sceptical view of one's own religion. © 2015 Research Institute for History, Leiden University.","Further Reformation; Hoornbeeck; Mission; Radical Enlightenment; World History",,,,01651153,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943264711

From the 1920s both Haushofers were influential within Nazism, although at different periods and under different circumstances. Karl Haushofer's complicity began in 1919 with his friendship with Rudolf Hess, an undergraduate student he taught political geography at the University of Munich. Hess introduced Haushofer to Adolf Hitler the following year. In 1924 Karl provided jail-house instruction in German geopolitical theory to both men while they served an eight-and-a-half month prison term for treason following the 'beer-hall putsch' of November 1923. Karl's prison lectures were significant because during that same period Hitler wrote Mein Kampf. In that tract, Hitler justifies German expansionism using Lebensraum, one of Haushofer's key ideas. It is here that there is a potential link between German geopolitics and the subsequent course of the Second World War. Albrecht Haushofer's complicity began in the 1930s when he started working as a diplomat for Joachim von Ribbentrop in a think-tank within the Nazi Foreign Ministry. He carried out several secret missions including negotiations with the Czech government over the Nazi annexation of Sudetenland. Karl's wife was Jewish, however, which according to Nazi Race Laws made Albrecht a Mischling [mixed-race]. Initially, Hess protected the family, but after he flew to Scotland in May 1941, circumstances became ever-more difficult for both Haushofers. Their tangled complicities and moral struggles were increasingly laboured and anguished, producing in the end tragic consequences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Albrecht Haushofer; Geopolitics; Karl Haushofer; Nazism; Second World War","biography; geopolitics; government relations; leadership; political geography; political history; war; Germany",,,03057488,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926335908

We do not systematically attack that reservoir because the only drug available, primaquine, is poorly suited to doing so. Primaquine was licenced for anti-relapse therapy in 1952 and became available despite threatening patients having an inborn deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) with acute haemolytic anaemia. The standard method for screening G6PD deficiency, the fluorescent spot test, has proved impractical where most malaria patients live. The blind administration of daily primaquine is dangerous, but so too are the relapses invited by withholding treatment. Absent G6PD screening, providers must choose between risking harm by the parasite or its treatment. How did this dilemma escape redress in science, clinical medicine and public health?

Memories of Germans expelled to West Germany disclose the various ways in which musical repertoire and musical practices are able to mitigate both the loss of the homeland and the distressing overall effects of expulsion, as well as reveal how music facilitates the building of a new sense of belonging in the face of geographic displacement and material dispossession. The study further highlights how the reframing and even silencing of musical practices on the other side of the Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia affected processes of social-identity reconstruction until and after the 1989 fall of Communism. Results of this study foreground that individual musical experiences reveal new historical narratives of how German expellees used and still use musical practices to negotiate intercultural power relationships and rebuild a sense of belonging in their respective post-war environment in West Germany or Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural memory; Germans from the Bohemian lands; musical practices and re-signification; musical recollections; narrative; oral history; phenomenological ethnography; Second World War expulsion; Sudeten Germans",,,,13507486,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928165271

The objective was also to raise awareness about the increasing need for education or awareness programs and patient counseling about Diabetes Mellitus in India. A cross sectional, non-interventional study was conducted at the out-patient and the in-patient departments of Internal Medicine at Owaisi Hospital and Research Centre, Hyderabad for 3 months on 500 patients using a questionnaire. Patients diagnosed with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus were considered for the study. The study throws light on the fact that a majority of the patients including the ones who had a positive family history (62.4%) of Diabetes Mellitus lack basic knowledge of Diabetes Mellitus like the risk factors, whether it is contagious or not, whether it is transmitted via blood or not, symptoms, long term complications, importance of diet and medication, etc. The study highlights the poor knowledge of the patients.

Study Design A secondary analysis of women enrolled in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial with a human chorionic gonadotropin-positive pregnancy test and whose last reproductive outcome was a loss were included in this analysis (n = 677). IPI was defined as the time between last pregnancy loss and last menstrual period of the current pregnancy and categorized by 3-month intervals. Pregnancy outcomes include live birth, pregnancy loss, and any pregnancy complications. These were compared between IPI groups using multivariate relative risk estimation by Poisson regression. Results Demographic characteristics were similar between IPI groups. The mean gestational age of prior pregnancy loss was 8.6 ± 2.8 weeks. The overall live birth rate was 76.5%, with similar live birth rates between those with IPI ≤3 months as compared to IPI >3 months (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.16). Rates were also similar for periimplantation loss (aRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.51-1.80), clinically confirmed loss (aRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-1.10), and any pregnancy complication (aRR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09) for those with IPI ≤3 months as compared to IPI >3 months. Conclusion Live birth rates and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, were not associated with a very short IPI after a prior pregnancy loss. The traditional recommendation to wait at least 3 months after a pregnancy loss before attempting a new pregnancy may not be warranted. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Absorbing metaphors from contemporary developments in media technologies, the debate pitted historical economists, who used statistics and cartography to make visible what they called the 'world economic organism', against marginalist economists, including a young Joseph Schumpeter, who rejected panoramic descriptions of the world economy for a narrow focus on prices. In a forgotten chapter in the conceptual genealogy of globalization, the debates of German-speaking economists initiated a persistent divide in how to see the world economy: either in the spatially expanding networks of communication and trade or in the wandering movement of prices on the world markets.

A web browser is not only used to surf the Internet, but also plays an important role as a portable operating system. For example, many users edit documents via an online editor and store the documents in an online storage repository. All those tasks are done with the help of a web browser. This results in a large number of attacks on web browsers. Therefore, the security of web browsers has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. Traditionally, when a user surfs on the Internet, his interaction with the browser is recorded. This scenario is called public browsing mode. Through attacking web browsers, attackers can obtain access to surfers’ private information, including surfing habits and passwords. The attackers are able to do this as web browsers always leave cookies, browsing histories and caches on the users’ computers. To avoid malicious attacks, many web browsers have developed private browsing mode mechanisms. In private browsing mode, a user’s behavior is not traced and his private information is retained as well. However, these mechanisms still create files such as bookmarks. Most importantly, the files downloaded through a web browser will be saved to disk unless the user deletes them himself. This is an extremely serious threat to the private security of web users. We designed a mechanism in Windows XP that observes the behaviors and patterns related to the creation and deletion of files in Firefox while in private browsing mode. We then focused on the files which were not deleted, and cleared them by means of anti-forensics manners. In other words, the web browsers can be made comprehensively secure with our mechanism. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anti-forensics; Malicious; Private browsing; Web security","Internet; Mobile security; Network security; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Anti-Forensics; Browsing history; Internet technology; Malicious; Malicious attack; Private browsing; Private information; WEB security; Web browsers","100-2221-E-015-001-MY2, NSC, National Science Council Taiwan; 101-2221-E-008-028-MY2, NSC, National Science Council Taiwan; 102-2221-E-015-001-, NSC, National Science Council Taiwan; 103-2623-E-008-003-D, NSC, National Science Council Taiwan",,13807501,,MTAPF,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924222024

It traces the origins of this norm to a critical juncture in the 1990s when the end of the Cold War ushered in a euphoric moment. Despite proclamations of the “end of history,” crises loomed large on the international stage where governance structures of an earlier era seemed like ancient relics no longer capable of managing problems of a new world order. As the World Bank and International Monetary Fund were attacked for conditionalities attached to their structural adjustment loans, the UN was overwhelmed with competing peacekeeping missions. Declining foreign aid and increasing conflicts relegated development to a lower rung of importance. As official development assistance fell, donor countries found themselves debating the future of development assistance and their role within it. Thus, international organizations created after World War II found themselves reflecting on their relevancy in a world that differed from the one that had given rise to them. In this moment of reflection, poverty was deployed as a strategic response to international institutions’ varying crises of relevancy. In that process, instead of seriously critiquing and reforming extant global governance structures, the convergence of international institutions on poverty resulted in a reinvention of development orthodoxy while maintaining the status quo. © 2015, Lynne Rienner Publishers.

Web storage with native browser support has changed the paradigm of web application development unprecedentedly because persistent data storage with increased data size can be realized on the client. Web storage is poised to quickly become an area of particular interest for forensic investigators due to the potential to discover critical information from web browser artifacts at client side. However, the literature work on web browser forensics has traditionally focused on browsing history, browser cache, and cookie files (Oh et al., 2011). Therefore, we first discuss the prevalence of web storage implementation in widely used websites. Then, we compare and contrast the web storage technology currently implemented in the five major web browsers, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari. Moreover, in order to provide more insights into web storage and enable unified forensic analysis, a proof-of-concept tool, named as BrowStEx (Browser Storage Extractor), is described with implementation details.

Many experienced animal keepers were drafted into the army and, despite all efforts to maintain normality; the difficulties of supply which were soon to follow led to the gradual decline of the zoo. The number of animals was reduced from almost 3500 to about only 400 by 1921 and subsequently the animal houses were closed to the public for several years. After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the autumn of 1918 there were long discussions as to what should happen to the whole area of Schönbrunn, what included the fate of the menagerie. Finally almost three years later the Ministry of Economy of the new Republic of Austria took over the Schönbrunn Zoo as part of the ""Schlosshauptmannschaft Schönbrunn"".

The author compares quotations from Soviet and Post-Soviet Belarusian textbooks. In modern educational sources the Soviet clichés are used, which carry a negative connotation, e.g. ""Great Power Chauvinism"", ""flag-waving"", ""imperialistic war"". Notably, such negative definitions are less common in Soviet school textbooks than in modern ones. The authors of modern Belarusian textbooks deny the patriotism of the citizens of the Russian empire and point out that the support of the motherland in the war was impossible without total government propaganda. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish quotations from Soviet and Post-Soviet academic textbooks. In one of the textbooks World War I is not described at all, being just mentioned in passing. The Soviet clichés have been carried over to the contemporary historical discourse. The events of World War I can hardly be used in the framing of the national Belarusian idea; therefore Belarusian researchers estimate the support of the Russian government by the Belarusian society during World War I negatively. During the early stage of the war the Belarusian nationalistic press did not support its country and declared that the Belarusian nationalists did not care which side got the victory. Some Belarusian nationalists collaborated with the German occupation authorities. Now these nationalists are treated as national heroes. The striving for justifying the actions of the national heroes led to the support of the old Soviet clichés concerning World War I and to the emergence of new ones. The tendency to idealize the bearers of the ideas of the Belarusian nationalism in the early XX century resulted in giving the ""required"" negative assessment to all the ideologically ""unfavorable"" events.","And-not our; Belorussian history textbooks; Early Belorussian nationalism; Historical memory; Our; Wars; World War I",,,,22199659,,,,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962905527

Digital computers were just becoming widely available and the founders quickly recognized the potential for automating laborious manual calculations and extending applications to problems not here-to-fore practical. Their shared vision of achieving economy and consistency in hydrologic analysis and in exploiting the use of digital computers resulted in the creation of the discipline known today as hydrologic engineering and the Hydrologic Engineering Center as the organizational vehicle for making their vision a reality. HEC was created as a three-pronged organization designed to achieve the goal of improving USACE capability for hydrologic engineering. The three elements of the HEC mission were methods systemization and training, research, and special assistance. The three elements of the mission were integrated to provide feedback from users in Corps field offices to HEC so that the work at HEC remained focused on the needs of engineers engaged in real-world problem solving. The size of HEC has remained remarkably constant over the years-about 35 permanent staff plus a complement of students. In its 50-year history the Hydrologic Engineering Center has been a model for the development of technical expertise and knowledge sharing. Its work has been acclaimed by many and emulated by others in both the public and private sectors, and it stands as a singular example of how the vision of its founders could endure through half a century of technological changes that surpassed even their greatest expectations of what the profession of hydrologic engineering could become. © 2015 ASCE.",,"Digital computers; Drought; Ecology; Ecosystems; Floods; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Engineering history; Hydrologic analysis; Knowledge-sharing; Public and private sector; Real-world problem solving; Shared vision; Technical expertise; Technological change; Water resources",,,,9780784479162,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84935047928

Rather, the naval leadership intended to adopt a system of mid-North Sea patrols during this period.

Method: All fetal echocardiograms performed in our institution from 2007 to 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Indication for referral, cardiac diagnosis based on the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases tenth revision criteria and the presence of chromosomal and extracardiac defects were recorded. Results: Of 1262 echocardiograms, 287 (22.7%) had CHD. Abnormal anatomy scan in pregnancies originally considered to be at low risk of CHD was the best indicator for detecting CHD (91.2% of positive cardiac diagnoses), compared with other indications of family history (5.6%) or maternal medical disorder (3.1%). Congenital anomalies of the cardiac septa comprised the largest category (n=89), within which atrioventricular septal defects were the most common anomaly (n=36). Invasive prenatal testing was performed for 126 of 287 cases, of which 44% (n=55) had a chromosomal abnormality. Of 232 fetuses without chromosomal abnormalities, 31% had an extracardiac defect (n=76). Conclusions: Most CHDs occur in pregnancies regarded to be at low risk, highlighting the importance of a routine midtrimester fetal anatomy scan.

In this study, we investigated the association of the rs7756992 of CDKAL1 and the rs4402960 of IGF2BP2 with Type 2 diabetes, diabetic complications (nephropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular disease), obesity and hypertension in a Tunisian population. Methods: A case-control association study including 200 Type 2 diabetes Tunisian patients (World Health Organization criteria) and 208 controls (age ≥40; fasting plasma glucose &lt;6.1mmol/L; without first degree family history of diabetes) has been performed. Other parameters such as diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, overweight/obesity and hypertension have been also collected. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan technology. Results: A significant association between the rs4402960 and Type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.34-2.58, P &lt; 10-4) has been found. Overweight/obese subjects bearing the T-allele have an increased risk to develop Type 2 diabetes (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.40-3.03, P &lt; 10-4). Furthermore, the rs7756992 was found to be associated with the reduced risk of diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.27-0.73, P = 0.001). Conclusions: The present study confirms that the rs4402960 of IGF2BP2 gene is a strong candidate for Type 2 diabetes susceptibility and overweight/obesity risk in the Tunisian population. Interestingly, our data suggest that the rs7756992 of CDKAL1 gene have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy. © 2014 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","CDKAL1; Genetic association; IGF2BP2; Tunisian population; Type 2 diabetes","binding protein; insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2; messenger RNA; somatomedin B; unclassified drug; CDKAL1 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase 5; IGF2BP2 protein, human; RNA binding protein; adult; Article; cardiovascular risk; CDKAL1 gene; cohort analysis; control; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic retinopathy; family history; female; gene; genetic association; genotype; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; second degree relative; single nucleotide polymorphism; Tunisian; world health organization; Cardiovascular Diseases; case control study; complication; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; diabetic retinopathy; follow up; genetic polymorphism; genetics; hypertension; middle aged; obesity; pathophysiology; prognosis; Tunisia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prognosis; RNA-Binding Proteins; Tunisia",,,17530393,,,24636221,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920136626

Study design A prospective observational data of 1059 women with singleton pregnancy screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 32 weeks gestation in a universal one-step screening and diagnostic strategy using 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing in an obstetric unit in Nigeria. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for GDM. Results The prevalence of gestational diabetes in accordance with 1999 WHO, new 2013 WHO modified IADPSG and IADPSG criteria was 3.8%, 8.1%, 7.5%, and 8.6%, respectively. Overt diabetes was diagnosed in 1.03% of the study population. Using the new consensus criteria, approximately 20% of GDM cases would have been missed if selective screening strategy was employed. Using multivariable analysis, glycosuria [aOR 8.60 (3.29-22.46)] and previous poor obstetric outcome [aOR 3.01 (1.23-7.37)] were significantly associated with GDM on 1999 WHO criteria. Glycosuria [aOR 2.54 (1.10-6.42)] was the only risk significantly associated with increased risk of developing GDM diagnosed based on new 2013 and IADPSG criteria.

This situation promises to worsen, as, increasingly, the administration of the Russian Federation appears to be preparing to enforce an official historiographic agenda. The agenda, inferred over the past several years by many professional observers and interpreters of the Russian administration’s words and deeds, is to promote a view of the country’s twentieth-century history which reactivates World War II-era nationalist narratives, justifies a centralized authoritarian model of government, and cultivates a sense of estrangement from the West.

Specifically, I examine the background of successive and overlapping colonial and neocolonial powers in three eras: late colonial (1901-1941), national developmental (1945-1964), and state authoritarianism (1965-1985). I also briefly examine the current neoliberal mineral regime (1986-present). I argue that, to date, capitalist enterprises and neocolonial powers have pursued two contradictory paths to extract precious (gold and silver) and base (chromite, iron, copper, nickel, magnesium, and ore) metals in the Philippines. On the one hand, mining companies appropriated expansive land, underpriced labor and inexpensive food to subsidize capital expenditure and mineral operations. The appropriation of basic inputs - or what is referred to as ""cheap natures"" - allowed these companies to reduce their sunken investments and operational costs. But on the other hand, as the sector developed more, it became increasingly difficult to appropriate such ""cheap natures."" While initially profitable because of successful appropriation of ""cheap natures,"" companies eventually experienced decreasing returns because of the problems this caused. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Philippine history; Political economy; Resource extraction; Southeast Asia; World-ecology",,,,2214790X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928929366

The Paris fair saw the culmination of a process that progressively transformed exhibitions from specialist fairs for the presentation of industrial innovations before a professional audience into recreational spaces for the amusement of much wider sectors of the population. This metamorphosis crystallized in the proliferation of technologically sophisticated attractions, such as the Théâtroscope, the Cinématophone, or the Panorama du Tour du Monde, aimed at seducing the spectator through the stimulation of the senses. These attractions included the ship-shaped Maréorama, which simulated a half an hour long trip along the Mediterranean with different illusions directed at all five senses simultaneously. In this article I shall make use of abundant documentary evidence to propose a reading of the Maréorama and its significant sensorial component. To this end, I shall reconstruct the functional operation of the attraction in detail, pointing out how it differs from similar devices built in the same period in the tradition of panoramatic objects.

However, it did not give rise to the rampant protectionism that followed the Great Crash. The idea that the rise in the fragmentation of production across global value chains - vertical specialization - may be a deterrent against protectionism is underappreciated in the literature. Institutions also played a role in limiting the extent of protectionist responses. World Trade Organization discipline raises the cost of using trade policies for member countries and has proved to be a stable foundation for the open multilateral trading system that has been built over the past 50 years. Using trade and protection data for seven large emerging market countries that have a history of active use of trade policy, the influence of these and other factors on trade policy responses to the 2008 crisis are empirically examined.

This study aims to assess racial/ethnic differences in relative contribution of risk factors of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic whites. Methods Pregnant women in 2007-2012 were identified through California state birth certificate records and linked to the electronic health records in a large mixed-payer ambulatory care organisation in Northern California (n=24195). Relative risk and population attributable fraction (PAF) for specific racial/ethnic groups were calculated to assess the contributions of advanced maternal age, overweight/obesity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards and World Health Organization (WHO)/American Diabetes Association (ADA) body mass index cut-offs for Asians), family history of type 2 diabetes, and foreign-born status. Results GDM was most prevalent among Asian Indians (19.3%). Relative risks were similar across all race/ethnic groups. Advanced maternal age had higher PAFs in non-Hispanic whites (22.5%) and Hispanics (22.7%). Meanwhile family history (Asian Indians 22.6%, Chinese 22.9%) and foreign-borne status (Chinese 40.2%, Filipinos 30.2%) had higher PAFs in Asian subgroups. Overweight/obesity was the most important GDM risk factor for non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, Asian Indians, and Filipinos when the WHO/ADA cut-off points were applied. Advanced maternal age was the only risk factor studied that was modified by race/ethnicity, with non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women being more adversely affected than other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions Overweight/obesity, advanced maternal age, family history of type 2 diabetes, and foreign-borne status are important risk factors for GDM.

Continuous urban expansion in territories poses a problem for its integration with the landscape, and highlights the need to preserve landscapes of cultural value, to recover others transformed by industrial activities, and to regulate the use of natural areas of landscape quality. However, nowadays, few countries have specific regulations that may serve as a reference for these kinds of projects. There are only twelve countries among more than 160 members of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Committee that have passed standards regarding the landscape. The absence of standardization is harmful in two ways: in the environmental sense (ecosystems and biodiversity) and in the social sense (culture, history, and the economy). On the other hand, there exists an extensive professional sector dedicated to the landscape, yet the lack of professionalization in its activities hinders free movement in searches for work abroad. For that reason, the purpose of this article is to study the standardization of the landscape and landscaping at an international level, providing a global vision of international regulations. Thirty-one state-of-the-art normative documents related to landscape have been found. This study deals with the current standards and the specifications developed by the national committees of standardization (ISO members) throughout the world. The normative documents identified during research and the public bodies that issue them are shown, and the structure and content of each one are analyzed. That is to say, first, the texts found may be grouped into two main approaches: standards/countries that focus more on landscape or nature conservation vs. those that focus more on planning. On the other hand, the documents are grouped according to four main themes: terminology and definitions of the landscape, the landscaping profession, rules for intervention in the landscape, and landscape protection measures. The standardization applied to the landscape is translated into the definition of a series of guidelines for action that allows minimization of the impact of our actions on the landscape, and that favors a better use of resources. The standardization of the landscape could be especially useful to those countries that, due to their high scenic quality landscapes, would obtain great benefits if they developed landscape norms. Nevertheless, standardization could favor any country since those with high landscape quality will do all they can to maintain said quality, and those countries that have landscapes in danger of deterioration, landscapes that are already deteriorated, or low quality landscapes will advocate for policies that contribute to the recovery of natural spaces. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ISO members; Landscape; Landscape architect; Landscape specifications; Normative documents; Standards; Terminology","Architecture; Biodiversity; Conservation; History; Land use; Regional planning; Specifications; Standards; Terminology; Architecture and engineering; International organization for standardizations; International regulations; ISO members; Landscape; Landscape architects; Landscape architecture; Normative documents; Standardization; environmental quality; global perspective; guideline; landscape protection; nature conservation; standardization; World",,,18666280,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924660825

Methods: The SPS3 trial enrolled 3,020 patients with lacunar strokes. Participants were stratified into groups of METS only, DM only, both, or neither using American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and World Health Organization guidelines. Annualized event rates of strokes, myocardial infarction (MI), and all-cause mortality were calculated, and hazard ratios (HRs) referencing the ""neither"" group were computed, controlling for significantly associated baseline characteristics. Results: Among 2,999 participants, 25% had METS only, 6% had DM only, 32% had both conditions, and 37% had neither. Over a median of 3.8 years of follow-up, there were 274 recurrent strokes (240 ischemic, 34 hemorrhagic) and 74 MIs; among the 240 ischemic strokes, 134 (56%) were lacunar. The rates of any recurrent stroke (HR 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.3) or lacunar stroke (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.7) were significantly higher for those with concurrent METS and DM compared with those who had neither. Risk of incident MI was higher in participants with DM (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.0) or concurrent DM and METS (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.9). Conclusion: METS and DM were significant comorbid conditions in lacunar stroke patients and they were associated with stroke recurrence. In patients with lacunar infarcts, a vigilant approach to prevent development of DM in those with METS may be a potential strategy to reduce recurrent strokes. © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.",,"high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; abdominal obesity; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; clumsy hand syndrome; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; dysarthria; female; follow up; heart infarction; hemiballism; hemiparesis; human; hypertension; impaired glucose tolerance; ischemic heart disease; lacunar stroke; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical society; metabolic syndrome X; mortality; motor dysfunction; multicenter study; national health organization; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; practice guideline; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; smoking; world health organization; complication; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; recurrent disease; risk factor; Stroke, Lacunar; United States; Aged; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Stroke, Lacunar; United States",,,00283878,,NEURA,26296518,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947270883

A key figure for IBM Finland was its chairman of the board from 1938 until 1959; long-time Finnish foreign minister Carl Enckell. He could for instance support IBM in supplying punched card machines for Finnish companies in charge of war reparations to the Soviet Union. After war reparations, IBM integrated its Finnish subsidiary into the corporation's new transnational manufacturing system in Europe, aimed at overcoming economic boundaries and duties as well as creating interdependence inside the company and the continent. Exceptionally, salesmen from IBM Finland also introduced an inter-bloc contact when they rented machines to a petrol company owned by the Soviet Union in Helsinki in the mid-1950s.

New finds of walrus bone and ivory in early Viking Age contexts in Iceland are concentrated in the south-west, and suggest extensive exploitation of nearby walrus for meat, hide and ivory during the first century of settlement. In Greenland, archaeofauna suggest a very different specialized long-distance hunting of the much larger walrus populations in the Disko Bay area that brought mainly ivory to the settlement areas and eventually to European markets.

It is produced by the dengue virus with four serotypes and transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a vector that coexists with humans and whose presence is favored by deficient sanitary, social and economic conditions. Manifestations of severe forms of the disease such as shock and bleeding, are related to the frequent co-circulation of the four serotypes and the emergence of new genotypes such as American / Asian serotype 2. The new classification of the disease by WHO as dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, is contributing to more timely diagnosis and treatment, enabling reductions in mortality.

This paper endeavours to set out its main aspects, and to show how the phenomenological approach translates into clinical terms and the clinician's presence in consultation. Method: The phenomenological approach gives priority to the patient's manner of being in the world, to his or her relationships with self and others, and to his/her life history, in other words the very foundations of the person's life experience. These dimensions, which are rarely put explicitly into words, are essential for the understanding of phenomena such as difficulty establishing contact with others, somatic expressions of psychic suffering, or the more ""aberrant"" symptoms of an illness. Access to these dimensions is gained in the course of intersubjective encounters, a fundamental component of the phenomenological approach. This paper thus sets out to show how, in this intersubjective perspective, psychopathological and therapeutic work can be undertaken. Results: Different moments are detailed and illustrated by clinical vignettes: a questioning of the actual possibility of the encounter in the setting of an illness, and the care required to let it re-emerge; the work on a shared understanding of the world of the Other, and the singular logic underpinning the way it is formed; attention to the body as the shared receptacle of presence; the elaboration of a diagnosis in which the illness is defined in reference to the dimensions of our shared human condition, rather than merely in contrast or contradiction with it. While in a phenomenological approach intersubjectvity provides the field for interplay, where not only the therapeutic provision but also the upstream diagnostic process are deployed and achieved, it must also be conceded that there is a radical personal implication by the clinician. There is an implication first in the actual occurrence of the encounter with the patient, sometimes very insecure, and then in feeling and apprehending what is played out in that encounter. Discussion: The authors demonstrate the tensions emerging from the confrontation between the phenomenological ""ideal"" and clinical reality, with emphasis on the cross-sectional aspects of phenomenology, which, although it is not a technique as such, is attentive to the anthropological stance suggested by Minkowkski: practising psychopathology with ""two voices"", rooted in the human encounter. The clinician working along phenomenological lines seeks to cast light on the patient's experience in its relationship to the form of his or her presence in the world, with its specific underpinnings in the living-experiencing body. The clinician thus distinguishes the logic of existence that underpins the symptoms of the illness, endeavouring with the patient to place his/her modes of being in a construction within which meaning can be shared, while at the same time taking care to avoid reinforcing alienation by descriptions overstepping the intersubjective domain. Conclusion: Any psychic suffering is a particular form of isolation or intersubjective disorder. Any ""treatment"" in psychiatry should therefore attach importance to the space for encounter where these sufferings and shortfalls can be addressed. It is important for suffering and shortfall to take on a shared meaning, since this enables both understanding and care provision. The need is to move from a situation experienced by the subject as placing him or her ""apart"", on the fringes of humanity, to a situation where the subject can feel recognised and integrated ""into the society of men"", with a place in a shared human world. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Embodied presence; Encounter; Intersubjectivity: being-in-the-world; Phenomenological attitude","Article; clinical practice; consultation; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test; female; human; human relation; logic; male; medical history; mental disease; mental health care; patient attitude; patient care; personal experience; phenomenology; psychosomatics; questionnaire; symptomatology; vignette",,,00143855,,EVPSA,,"French",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945437520

The previous article also dealt with the necessity for founding a non-profit organization, NPO-WFSLMS, to handle the commercial and social responsibilities of the WFSLMS. For details, please refer to that previous article. Meetings: The 2ndWFSLMS congress was successfully held in 2009 in Japan, under the presidency of Professor Krishna Rau. The third WFSLMS meeting was planned for Paris in 2013 together with the 20thISLSM congress under the Meeting Presidency of Dr Jean Abitbol, while the 19thISLSM was to be held in Korea in 2011 under the Meeting Presidency of Prof. Jin-Wang Kim. Unforseen problems beyond the control of the organizers forced the cancellation of both the 19thand 20thmeetings of the ISLSM, the latter also being the location of the planned third WFSLMS congress in Paris, but with the cooperation of the organizers of the 5thcongress of the International Phototherapy Association (IPTA) the 3rd WFSLMS meeting was held in Lithuania, again under the presidency of Prof Rau concurrently with the 20thISLSM, at which much was debated regarding the future course of NPO-WFSLMS and WFSLMS. The venue of the 2015 21st ISLSM Congress was set as Indore, India, and the 4thWFSLMS meeting was allocated to Florence, Italy, in tandem with the 22ndISLSM congress. Projects: In the interim, NPO-WFSLMS effectively managed laser education programs in Japan for developing country doctors, and also handled the donation of laser systems to Vietnam and Thailand, the latter being under the auspices of the Greek Medical Laser Association, together with associated education programs. The laser-based Blood Saving Campaign (BSaC) has been actively promoted in Asian countries up to the present, designed to minimize the need for transfusions and prevent intraoperative blood loss through the hemostatic properties of surgical lasers, bloodless minimally-invasive treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT) and noninvasive LLLT. The Future: The WFSLMS will make more active overtures to solidify the inter-society cooperation among as many of the major laser societies as possible, both national and international. There are problems to be faced and overcome, but in a mood of cautious optimism, NPO-WFSLMS will work with WFSLMS and ISLSM towards this very worthwhile goal. © 2015 JMLL, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Article; biogeographic region; cooperation; health care personnel; health care planning; health program; health promotion; history of medicine; human; information dissemination; Japan; laser surgery; licensing; medical decision making; medical education; medical practice; non profit organization; phototherapy; professional delegation; professional knowledge; treatment indication; World Federation of Societies for Laser Medicine and Surgery",,,08985901,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926218197

In 2000, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared a part of it aWorld Heritage Site. Actually, the Palmeral is a historic irrigation system with rows of palm trees flanking rectangular fields and serving as a windbreak and shade for the cultivation of wheat, alfalfa, fruit trees and vegetables. This system and its cultivation methods were mainly developed during the Islamic period and maintained after the Christian Reconquista in 1265 until recently. The main canal Acequia Mayor supplies irrigation water from the Vinalopó River which is then distributed through secondary canals to the different subsystems and fields as well as for domestic purposes. With an average slope of 1:260 (4‰) the main canal has a flow capacity of about 600 L/s. Owing to the topography, the canal must overcome a number of vertical drops where hydraulic energy must be dissipated. Beside the drop structures, at the same time watermills generate water power for flour production. These watermills have been built since the Islamic era and operated until the last century, when they were abandoned or converted for other uses. There are some descriptive publications and documents dealing with the mills, but there has not yet been any attempt to conduct a technical survey and interpretation. This study explores the remains of 11 watermills and determines the dimensions and technical parameters of this hydro-system. The mills were equipped with turbine-type horizontal waterwheels with hydraulic heads between two and more than 15 m. The observations allow conclusions on mill operation, power yield and flour production. A comprehensive description of this early example of waterpower generation in a multipurpose system is undertaken. © 2015 IWA Publishing.","Elche; Irrigation; Palm grove; Spain; Water engineering; Water history; Watermills; Waterpower","Canals; Drops; Forestry; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulic structures; Irrigation; Orchards; Water power; Water supply; Elche; Palm grove; Spain; Water engineering; Water history; Watermills; Irrigation canals; alfalfa; canal; distribution system; exploitation; fruit; historical record; hydroelectric power; irrigation system; mill; monocotyledon; UNESCO; vegetation; water supply; wheat; wind break; World Heritage Site; Article; documentation; energy consumption; environmental exploitation; grinding; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); river; seasonal variation; soil erosion; Spain; summer; topography; velocity; water flow; water supply; watermill; Alicante [Comunidad Valencia]; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Vinalop?

The spotlight is the actual problems of history and attempts of the Russian science to “embed” into the context of the new approaches. The paper highlights the civilizational approach and simplification of its understanding, as well as the interpretation of the complexity of “modernism” and “postmodernism” concepts in the sociocultural studies. The central problem is the problem of objectivity of historical knowledge in the glocalization stage and ways to its solution it in the context of the transition from the industrial to the postindustrial society. The scale of its value system is analyzed as a new milestone, which significantly modifies the methodological strategies of the historical science in particular, and the humanitaristics in general.

The two nations had different concepts of citizenship and constitutions but, in what has been called ""hemispheric orientalism,"" prejudice knew no border. Both countries severely restricted immigration from Japan. In the United States, immigrants, the Issei, were aliens ineligible for citizenship. Thus, states could deny their access to commercial fishing and the right to own or lease land. Because the American constitution bestows full citizenship on the native-born, their American-born children, the Nisei, could vote and acquire land, but experienced discrimination especially in employment. On paper, the Canadian Issei had more civil rights since they could become naturalized but this provided few advantages apart from the rights to own land and to fish commercially. The Canadian Nisei had no more rights than their parents. In British Columbia, where 95 percent of the Japanese lived, they could not vote and provincial laws and customs denied their access to many occupations. During the Second World War, both nations required all the Nikkei to leave the Pacific Coast, incarcerated some, severely restricted the mobility of others, and proposed to ""repatriate"" many of them to Japan. Drawing mainly on the previous scholarship which has examined specific themes, time periods, or comparisons, this article offers an overview of how between the 1890s and the 1940s the effects of prejudice varied more in detail and timing than in principle even though formal consultation between the two nations was sporadic. © 2015 ACSUS.","American/Canadian comparisons; Citizenship; Immigration; Japanese Americans; Japanese Canadians; World War II","Asian immigrant; citizenship; civil rights; historical geography; Orientalism; social history; Canada; United States",,,02722011,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928103348

This article proposes to address this criticism by re-examining salient features of Zhongguo's etymological past. The discussion is divided into two parts. The first part offers an overview of the term's historical usage and argues that contrary to the common view, Zhongguo as applied to the imagined whole of Chinese political and cultural traditions or to any of its discrete period segments had not been employed primarily as an ethnocentric expression but as a simple identity label. The second part revisits a late Qing (c. 1861-1912) episode in which Chinese writers made a rare, if not unprecedented, attempt to dispute and, indeed, to reject the name in light of the foreign criticism. Though their arguments did not, in the end, alter how nationalists named the Chinese nation, these debates revealed a cultural posture that became prevalent as educated Chinese negotiated the crossroads of modernity.

There is insufficient data as to the nature and magnitude of these opacities in the treated cases of tuberculosis. Aims and Objectives: This study evaluates the nature and magnitude of residual radiological opacities and of complete radiological resolution in new successfully treated cases of tuberculosis. Design: Four hundred and forty one new cases of pulmonary, pleural or mediastinal tuberculosis were radiologically evaluated by chest x-ray, PA view, at the start and end of a successful treatment, which was as per the World Health Organization (WHO), Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), and Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course (DOTS) guidelines. Patients with a previous history of tuberculosis or other lung conditions, treatment failure, retreatment cases, and multidrug tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases were excluded. Results: Residual x-ray lesions were seen in 178 cases of tuberculosis (40.36%). Complete radiological resolution was seen in 263 cases (59.64%). Of the residual lesions, 67.4% were parenchymal were parenchymal in nature, 23.59% were pleural lesions and 8.99% were mediastinal lesions.

Occasionally other abdominal structures may be found within the hernial sac. Rarely femoral hernias may contain metastatic tumour deposits. Presentation of case: We report the case of an 82 year old lady with a background of ovarian carcinoma, who presented with acute small bowel obstruction and an irreducible right groin mass. CT imaging revealed an incarcerated loop of small bowel within a femoral hernia sac. The patient proceeded to theatre for hernia repair. Upon opening the hernial sac an adherent incarcerated small bowel loop was discovered. Interestingly, the sac itself was lined with metastatic deposits, which were later histologically proven to be ovarian in origin. The sac was reduced and the hernia was repaired. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. Discussion: As abdominal wall hernias communicate with the abdominal cavity there is the potential for malignant cells to seed the peritoneal lining of the hernia sac. If the sac also contains bowel wall, this may become involved in the tumour mass. This may result in small bowel incarceration & obstruction. Conclusion: In cases, where there is a known intra-abdominal malignancy & the presence of an incarcerated hernia, there should be a high index of suspicion for the presence of tumour within the hernial contents. © 2015 The Authors.","Bowel obstruction; Cancer; Femoral hernia; Incarcerated; Ovarian; Strangulated","analgesic agent; anticoagulant agent; abdominal distension; aged; analgesia; appendectomy; Article; cancer surgery; case report; computer assisted tomography; cytoreductive surgery; female; femoral hernia; follow up; hernia incarceration; hospital admission; human; human tissue; liver metastasis; nausea; ovary metastasis; patient history of surgery; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; skin incision; small intestine obstruction; spleen metastasis; thrombosis; thrombosis prevention; very elderly; vomiting; world health organization",,,22102612,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928723638

Initial observations regarding the functions of cardiopulmonary systems served as a platform for the tremendous progress achieved in the past century, with the most significant event being the introduction and standardization of right heart catheterization. The advent of the pulmonary hypertension epidemic due to aminorex galvanized the medical community to learn more about this fatal disease, major outcome being the formation of the PPH Registry from which the natural history, epidemiology and clinical features were gathered. These initial efforts paved the way for tremendous advances which followed in screening, diagnosis, and discovery of targeted therapies.

First, I discuss some fundamental issues inextricably linked to his work: the difference and relation of a ""secular world"" to the Christian notion of the ""world,"" the difference and relation between the concepts of ""history"" given with human ""progress"" appearing in the field of bioethics, in contrast to the Christian understanding of God's story with His ""world."" These issues will be discussed in connection with the philosophical work of Karl Löwith and Jürgen Habermas, among others. Next, I critically discuss Engelhardt's genealogical account of ""modernity,"" in order to draw-with agreement-attention to this genealogy's implications for the Christian epistemology needed for a proper understanding of human nature (the conditio humana). Discursive rational argument is not enough to secure a proper understanding of human nature, says Engelhardt. Yet, it will be shown that through the practice of Christian witness as a ""good work""-which brings along with it different essential modes of understanding human nature-the Christian can encounter secular public discourse. I examine how the witness of a Christian ethos may contribute indispensable insights for public and secular discourse; this witness, I argue, implies radical consequences for medical research and treatment. Despite my general agreement with his work, one of my central theses will be that Engelhardt rests content too early in embracing an empty procedural account of the justice that can be achieved by the state. Christian witness can and ought to contribute more than this. © The Author 2015.","Bioethics; Biopolitics; Christian bioethics; Common world; Conditio humana; Epistemology; Genealogy; Good works; History-story; Human nature; Judgment; Justification; Liberal state; Modernity; Morality; Practical reason; Public discourse; Secularization; Translation; Understanding; Witness",,,,13803603,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949210526

Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed while it is occurring - perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions. We formulate this problem over discrete-time SEIRS-type diffusion models in terms of maximum likelihood. We design methods that are based on sub modularity and a novel prize-collecting dominating-set vertex cover (PCDSVC) relaxation that can identify likely diffusion steps with some provable performance guarantees. Our methods are the first to be able to reconstruct complete diffusion histories accurately in real and simulated situations. As a special case, they can also identify the initial spreaders better than existing methods for that problem. Our results for both meme and contaminant diffusion show that the partial diffusion data problem can be overcome with proper modeling and methods, and that hidden temporal characteristics of diffusion can be predicted from limited data. © 2014 IEEE.","diffusion; epidemics; history","Computer viruses; Data mining; Disease control; Epidemiology; History; Impurities; Maximum likelihood; Spreaders; Water pollution; Contaminant diffusion; Continuous monitoring; epidemics; Partial diffusion; Performance guarantees; Real-world process; Temporal characteristics; Water contaminants; Diffusion",,,15504786,,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936972899

The efficacy of second-line mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in pazopanib-treated patients has also been evaluated in clinical trials; however, few studies have evaluated first-line pazopanib or second-line mTOR inhibitors in real-world settings. The present study evaluated the outcomes of first-line pazopanib, and pazopanib followed by mTOR inhibitors, in a community oncology setting. Patients and Methods The present study was a retrospective analysis of eligible patients in US Oncology's iKnowMed electronic health records database who had been treated for aRCC from November 1, 2009 to August 31, 2012. The patients received first-line therapy with pazopanib (cohort 1), followed by second-line therapy with either everolimus or temsirolimus (cohort 2). The key outcomes included overall survival (OS), PFS, adverse events (AEs), treatment patterns, and healthcare resource use. Results The median OS in cohort 1 (n = 177) was 22 months, and the median PFS was 8.5 months. The most common AEs were fatigue (56%), diarrhea (52%), vomiting (44%), and nausea (40%). The median persistence was 151 days with pazopanib. The median OS in cohort 2 (n = 35) was 16 months; the median PFS was 5.7 months. The most common AEs were fatigue (51%) and nausea (34%). The median persistence was 93 days with everolimus and 49 days with temsirolimus. Conclusion The outcomes for the patients treated with first-line pazopanib in the community setting were consistent with those reported by previous prospective and retrospective studies.

The study was done in Hafez Hospital of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. 150 menopausal women suffering from osteoporosis were chosen. In randomized block design, the individuals were placed in the vitamin C (test) and placebo (control) groups. The test group received orally 1000 mg of vitamin C in two divided doses for 6 months and the control group similarly had placebo. Test parameter: Bone mineral density (BMD). Before treatment, considering some demographic specifications and the results of BMD were not different statistically (P>0.05) but there was significant difference in the age and obstetric history (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between obstetric history with lumbar BMD (r= -295 and P<0.001) and femoral BMD (r= -0.226 and P=0.006).

Yet, six years after its introduction, this convention was still not generally known to the developers. Two existing solutions could help in these cases. First, one can deprecate entities, but, in our example, one can hardly deprecate Java's method. Second, one can create a system-specific rule to be automatically enforced. In a preceding publication, we showed that system-specific rules are more likely to be noticed by developers than generic ones. However, in practice, developers rarely create specific rules. We therefore propose to free the developers from the need to create rules by automatically detecting such conventions from source code repositories. This is done by mining the change history of the system to discover similar changes being applied over several revisions. The proposed approach is applied to a real-world system, and the extracted rules are validated with the help of experts. The results show that many rules are in fact relevant for the experts. © 2015 ElsevierInc.Allrightsreserved.","Automatic coding convention detection; Mining software repositories; Software evolution","Hardware; Automatic Detection; Change history; Java generics; Mining software repositories; Real-world system; Software Evolution; Source code repositories; System specific; Software engineering",,,01641212,,JSSOD,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941268844

Using a new data-set of daily prices of French war debt issued and traded in London, it looks for structural breaks in the time series using a four-step rolling windows algorithm. The data confirm that contemporary actors reacted strongly to some events considered to be less relevant by historians, such as the Battles of Jutland and Caporetto, and did not significantly react to other events generally considered by historians to be turning points for the war effort, such as the German Michael Offensive, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare. The analysis indicates that contemporary views of turning points in the war differed significantly from those in ex post historical accounts, indicating that the relative importance placed on certain events by historians might not reflect the views held by contemporary financial and political actors. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","First World War; fixed income; sovereign debt; structural breaks; war finance","capital market; debt; economic history; finance; historical perspective; income; perception; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",,,03585522,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924133904

Methods: The study collected data about stressful life events, family history of diabetes, lifestyle, demographics and minimum anthropometrics from left-behind famers aged 40-70. years. Calculated life event index was applied to assess the combined effects of stressful life events experienced by the left-behind farmers and its association with impaired fasting glucose was estimated using binary logistic regression models. Results: The prevalence of abnormal fasting glucose was 61.4% by American Diabetes Association (ADA) standard and 32.4% by World Health Organization (WHO) standard. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed a coefficient of 0.033 (P<. .001) by ADA standard or 0.028 (P<. .001) by WHO standard between impaired fasting glucose and life event index. The overall odds ratios of impaired glucose for the second, third and fourth (highest) versus the first (lowest) quartile of life event index were 1.419 [95% CI. = (1.173, 1.717)], 1.711 [95% CI. = (1.413, 2.071)] and 1.957 [95% CI. = (1.606, 2.385)] respectively by ADA standard. When more and more confounding factors were controlled for, these odds ratios remained statistically significant though decreased to a small extent. Conclusions: The left-behind farmers showed over two-fold prevalence rate of pre-diabetes than that of the nation's average and their risk of impaired fasting glucose was positively associated with stressful life events in a dose-dependent way.

The human world is substantially different from the world of nature: history which shapes human world is a human creation and the nature is not. Therefore, we cannot realize the nature or the natural world (which is known only by its creator). Nevertheless, we can realize the history since it is our product (in accordance with the criteria contained in Vico's famous statement verum et factum convertuntur). In his main work The New Science Vico surpasses quantifying reductionism of rationalist Enlightenment naturalism as well as the traditionalist erudite philologism, but not the dualism of nature and history. Vico's ""new science"", which represents the union of philology and philosophy of history, is based on an examination of the common nature of all people, which refers to all nations, civilizations, and cultures. This new science is focused on discovering the principle according to which people construct their historical world. It is precisely the concept of common human nature which offers an explanation how it is that similar ideas, structures, practices, and institutions develop in different eras and diverse environments. Therefore the world, no matter how diverse and differentiated, essentially is a unique world of humanity. But Vico's concept of an ideal eternal history (storia ideale eterna) opens the question whether this world is only a product of logic embedded in its very own structure (expressed with the notion of providence). Accordingly, humans can be seen just as executors of that logic and not free creators of their own world.","Giambattista Vico; History; Nature; Providence; World",,,,03527875,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992187401

First, the collapse of communism in 1989 rendered necessary a complete reorganisation of the sport and football landscape in eastern Germany. Second, in parallel with the award in the year 2000 of the right to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup in the Federal Republic of Germany, a significant upturn took place in academic research on football. The reappraisal of the National Socialist era, in particular, has experienced a noticeable upswing since the year 2000. The present article focuses on several key thematic areas that shape current research and will shape research in the future. They include, first, the question of the character of the Vereine (here: football clubs) under the conditions of a communist dictatorship, and second, an increased interest in the biographical component of the history of the development of football. At the same time, it is clear that by now the question of a memory culture in football is no longer limited to national perspectives such as the reappraisal of the ""Miracle of Bern."" Rather, the dynamic development of European football renders possible the emergence of European realms of shared memory. At the same time, a boom in public engagement with football history can be observed in Germany and elsewhere. This holds true for both the social commemoration of footballers who were victims of war and tyranny and for popular cultural publications. In recent years, therefore, there has not only been an increase in the ""museumisation"" but also in the media marketing of football history. Thus, football history itself has become a market that is served by various stakeholders, such as clubs, companies, and the media. © GESIS.","Biography; Collective memory; Culture of remembrance; FRG; GDR; German football; German unity; Public history; Transformation; World Cup",,,,01726404,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979792307

The first Soviet WC-10%Co carbide grade was developed and implemented by G.A. Meerson at the Moscow Electro-Plant in 1929 and had the brand name ""POBEDIT"", the word originated from the Russian word POBEDA - victory. The brand name POBEDIT became a common noun soon, and even now many people use it to designate cemented carbide in Russia instead of the technically correct terms ""hard alloy"" or ""hardmetal"". Nearly 16 t of POBEDIT were fabricated in 1931, which was more than the total estimated production of cemented carbides in the Western countries in the early 1930's. Later on, the carbide production was transferred to the Moscow Plant of Rare Chemical Elements and the full-scale production - from the fabrication of tungsten anhydride to sintered carbide articles - was started there in the beginning of the 1930's. In the late 30's the Plant was renamed as the Moscow Cemented Carbide Plant (MKTC) and is now part of Sandvik.

This review summarizes the major pathological factors linking obesity to diabetes, focussing on current epidemiological data related to obese diabetic patients in the Arab world, the etiology of the disease and the genetic determinants of diabetes and obesity. There are alarming data related to the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in children of Arab ethnicity. Replication studies identify several genetic variants in Arabs with obesitylinked diabetes. For example, variants of the ADIPOQ gene (the rs266729 single-nucleotide polymorphism) are associated with obesity and diabetes in various Arab countries. Gaps exist in our information about diabetes and obesity in Arab populations in relation to ethnic-specific cut-off points for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Further genome-wide association studies in obese and diabetic Arab populations could add to our understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention and reversal of this disease. © 2015, World Health Organization.

In order to solve this problem, we propose trace hiding strategy based on group signature (THGS) in the paper. The principle of group signature is applied to create a group and HTTP proxy server uses the unified account which is shared between group members to login specific websites instead of a single group member. In addition, HTTP proxy server encrypts the response from web server with RSA and forwards it to client. Moreover, authentic membership, trustable proxy and the efficient forwarding are researched in this paper. In the experimental part, we achieved the establishment of groups based on group signature and HTTP proxy server.

The First World War represents a moment in the French literary field which saw an explosion of war narratives. The legitimacy of some of these narratives was questioned after the war by Jean Norton Cru, who examined their validity as testimonies in a book significantly entitled Témoins. Following Ricœur’s claim that historical discourse is, in any case, ‘metaphorical’, I argue that in fact these texts provoke an extension or revision of historical meaning and understanding, expressing a dynamic interrelation between the prefigured field of discursive forms and the fluctuating field of material happenings, and as such act as testimonies.

Herein we compare the risk factors of early PGC with distal gastric carcinoma (DGC) in patients treated at a single tertiary hospital in China. Methods: Risk factors of 379 consecutive surgically resected early gastric carcinoma (EGC) diagnosed according to the 2010 World Health Organization criteria were studied by reviewing their medical records and esophagogastroduodenoscopy/biopsy findings and interviewing patients and family members for the patients' history of environmental toxin exposure (ETE), dietary habits, family (FCH) and personal cancer history (PCH) and survival. Differences between PGC (n=115), DGC (n=264) and age-matched and gender-matched controls (n=225) were compared. Results: Proportion of early PGC in all EGC patients was increased significantly (P<0.05). The independent risk factors for both PGC and DGC identified by multivariate analysis were intake of preserved food and little fruit, and gastric mucosal intestinal metaplasia and atrophy (all P<0.05). Advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 9.83, P<0.01), PCH (OR 5.09, P<0.05), a high body mass index (>24kg/m2) (OR 2.79, P<0.01) and ETE (OR 2.31, P<0.05) were independent risk factors for PGC, but not male gender, tobacco or alcohol abuse, hiatus hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease or columnar-lined esophagus. In contrast, FCH (OR 2.34, P<0.01) and Helicobacter pylori infection (OR 2.81, P<0.001) were independent risk factors for DGC. Conclusion: Independent risk factors for PGC in Chinese patients differ from those of DGC or esophageal adenocarcinoma, supporting the classification of PGC as a separate gastric carcinoma entity in the Chinese populations. © 2015 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Chinese; Early gastric carcinoma; Epidemiology; Proximal gastric carcinoma; Stomach neoplasms","adult; Article; body mass; cancer staging; Chinese; controlled study; dietary intake; environmental exposure; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; family history; female; Helicobacter infection; human; human tissue; intestine metaplasia; major clinical study; male; medical record; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; stomach biopsy; stomach carcinoma; survival; world health organization; adverse effects; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; carcinoma; China; classification; diet; ethnology; factual database; middle aged; statistical model; Stomach Neoplasms; world health organization; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Carcinoma; China; Databases, Factual; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms; World Health Organization",,,17512972,,,25754397,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937028770

Study design: A systematically conducted narrative review. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of all primary studies published between January 1990 and June 2013 from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Maldives located through the following data bases: PubMed, PubMed central, EMBASE, MEDLINE, BioMed central, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and electronic libraries of the authors' institutions. Data extraction and quality appraisal of included studies was done independently by two authors and findings were synthesized in a narrative manner as meta-analysis was found to be inappropriate due to heterogeneity of the included studies. Results: Eleven primary studies were included in the final review, all of which were conducted in school settings in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Prevalence of overweight and obesity showed wide variations in the included studies. The key individual risk factors with statistically significant associations to overweight and obesity included: lack of physical activities reported in six studies; prolonged TV watching/playing computer games reported in four studies; frequent consumption of fast food/junk food reported in four studies; and frequent consumption of calorie dense food items reported in two studies. Family level risk factors included higher socioeconomic status reported in four studies and family history of obesity reported in three studies. Conclusion: This review provides evidence of key contributors to the increasing burden of obesity and overweight among children and adolescents in South Asia, and demonstrates the nutritional transition that characterizes other developing countries and regions around the world. The findings have implications for policy, practice and the development of interventions at various levels to promote healthy eating and physical activity among children and adolescents in the region as well as more globally. © 2014 The Royal Society for Public Health.","Adolescents; Children; Nutrition; Obesity; Overweight; Physical activity; South Asia","adolescence; child; developing world; nutrition; obesity; physical activity; risk factor; adolescent; Bangladesh; Bhutan; body mass; caloric intake; child; childhood obesity; computer; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; dose response; family history; fast food; food; geographic distribution; health care cost; health care policy; health care practice; health education; human; India; junk food; library; Maldives; medical research; Nepal; Pakistan; pathophysiology; physical activity; prevalence; qualitative analysis; quality control; quantitative analysis; Review; risk factor; socioeconomics; South Asian; Sri Lanka; statistical significance; systematic review; television; watching television; Asia; Overweight; Pediatric Obesity; risk factor; South Asia; Adolescent; Asia; Child; Humans; Overweight; Pediatric Obesity; Risk Factors",,,00333506,,PUHEA,25746156,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925184390

The aim of the study was to investigate the socio-demographic profile and clinical correlates in early onset psychosis. Method: Forty-five adolescents with first episode early onset psychosis were assessed by a clinical interview, socio-demographic questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Symptom Onset in Schizophrenia (SOS) score, the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO ASSIST) questionnaire for substance misuse and a urine cannabis level. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 15.9 years (SD 1.8, range 10-18 years). Thirty-one (69%) were male. There was a poor recognition of the prodromal period in 22 (49%) patients and caregivers. The mean duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was 27.2 weeks (SD 56.7). There was a negative correlation between DUP and age of onset (p<0.05). Mean age at onset of psychosis (males 15.7 years, SD 2.2, and females 15.3 years, SD 2.6) and mean age of presentation (males 16.0 years, SD 1.8, and females 15.5 years, SD 1.7) was slightly younger in the females than males, but not statistically significant. A total of 25 (56%) adolescents reported lifetime cannabis use and 24 (96%) were male. Conclusion: Symptoms of the prodromal period were poorly recognised. The mean DUP suggests a significant delay in treatment and younger children had a longer DUP. The gender differences in presentation (marginal) and substance use (highly significant) suggests that there may be different environmental risk factors for males and females in early onset psychosis or that early onset psychosis is more genetically homogenous and less dependent on environmental triggers. © 2015 NISC Pty Ltd.",,"amphetamine derivative; cannabis; nicotine; adolescent; adult; Article; cannabis use; caregiver; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; drug misuse; drug urine level; family history; female; first degree relative; first episode early onset psychosis; human; male; onset age; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; prodromal symptom; psychiatric treatment; psychosis; questionnaire; recognition; schizophrenia assessment; screening test; sex difference; social status; Symptom Onset in Schizophrenia; traditional healer; World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test; child; prodromal symptom; psychology; Psychotic Disorders; risk factor; schizophrenia; South Africa; Adolescent; Caregivers; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Prodromal Symptoms; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; South Africa","NIH, National Institutes of Health",,17280583,,,26357916,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941639300

There is no established explanation for these phenomena. I have previously written on this problem. Here, I elaborate on my previous papers in three ways.

This cohort had a significantly shorter lifespan than the late 1918 ""non-combat"" cohort, with median ages of death being 65.9 versus 74.2, respectively (a difference of 8.3 years shown also in Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log rank P<0.001). The difference for the lifespan of veterans in the postwar period was more modest, with median ages of death being 72.6 versus 74.3, respectively (a difference of 1.7 years, log rank P=0.043). There was no evidence for differences between the cohorts in terms of occupational class, based on occupation at enlistment.Conclusions Military personnel going to the first world war in 1914 from New Zealand lost around eight years of life (relative to a comparable military cohort).

We examined the associations between the healthy diet indicator (HDI) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in three CEE/FSU populations.Subjects/Methods:Dietary intakes of foods and nutrients, assessed by food frequency questionnaire in the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) cohort study, were used to construct the HDI, which follows the WHO 2003 dietary recommendations. Among 18 559 eligible adult participants (age range: 45-69 years) without a history of major chronic diseases at baseline, 1209 deaths occurred over a mean follow-up of 7 years. The association between HDI and mortality was estimated by Cox regression.Results:After adjusting for covariates, HDI was inversely and statistically significantly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, but not with other cause-specific and all-cause mortality in the pooled sample. Hazard ratios per one standard deviation (s.d.) increase in HDI score were 0.95 (95% confidence interval=0.89-1.00, P=0.068), 0.90 (0.81-0.99, P=0.030) and 0.85 (0.74-0.97, P=0.018) for all-cause, CVD and CHD mortality, respectively. Population attributable risk fractions for low HDI were 2.9% for all-cause, 14.2% for CVD and 10.7% for CHD mortality. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that unhealthy diet has had a role in the high CVD mortality in Eastern Europe. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this article we examine how World’s Fair exhibitors sought to make visible educational practices and institutions for external validation. Focusing especially on the American education exhibits mounted at Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876), Chicago (1893), and Paris (1900), we use historical documents connected with the preparation of exhibits as well as reports written during and after the Fairs to bring to light the curatorial principles and exhibitionary practices governing education exhibits. This examination helps us to understand educational accountability mechanisms and procedures not simply as technical undertakings, but as social systems with an important set of effects. The scopic systems at play and in contestation for accurately and fairly presenting education systems for outside scrutiny did much to shape the national/international contexts within which school systems operate as well as in what directions educators and policymakers sought to direct/redirect schooling. © 2014, Arizona State University.

To unravel this heterogeneity, we examine the historical trajectory of trauma-related diagnoses. Our review addresses four traumas (i.e., combat, natural disaster, life-threatening accident and sexual assault) that have contributed the most to conceptual models of PTSD. Although these trauma types are all subsumed under the same diagnostic label, our literature review indicates that the psychological consequences of different traumatic experiences are traditionally studied in isolation. Indeed, most research addresses hypotheses regarding specific trauma types using samples of individuals selected for their experience with that specific event. We consider the possibility that PTSD is not a single, unified construct and what this means for future research and clinical applications. © 2014.","Combat; Diagnosis; Life-threatening accidents; Natural disasters; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Sexual assault","accident; arousal; battle injury; differential diagnosis; disease severity; DSM-5; DSM-III; DSM-IV; fear; gross stress reaction; heart palpitation; helplessness; human; life event; natural disaster; neurasthenia; post Vietnam syndrome; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological well being; psychosomatic disorder; Review; sexual abuse; sexual assault; shell shock; shock; stress; symptomatology; transient situational disturbance; Viet Nam; war; war neurasthenia; Western Hemisphere; Combat Disorders; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; disaster; forecasting; history; male; mental stress; pathophysiology; psychology; sexual crime; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Ventricular Flutter; Accidents; American Civil War; Combat Disorders; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Disasters; Forecasting; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Neurasthenia; Sex Offenses; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Ventricular Flutter; Vietnam Conflict; World War I; World War II",,,08876185,,JADIE,25261838,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908375898

Eggs from roundworm, whipworm, tapeworm and capillariids were identified. The morphological and morphometrical comparison, followed by statistical analyses, showed that the Carspach capillariid eggs are similar to rodent parasites. Poor sanitary conditions in the trenches, the lack of knowledge of parasites, and the widespread presence of commensal animals, can explain the occurrence of such parasites in human intestines. This study is the second dealing with 20th century human samples. It confirms the presence of intestinal worms in First World War German soldiers. In this case study, the application of statistics to precise measurements facilitated the diagnosis of ancient helminth eggs and completed the microscopic approach.

Population-based data are lacking on the burden and risk factors for obstetric complications in settings with low rates of institutional delivery. We sought to describe the prevalence of reported complications and to analyze risk factors for obstetric complications and near misses, using data from a representative, rural setting of Bangladesh.Methods: This study utilized existing data on 42,214 pregnant women enrolled in a micronutrient supplementation cohort trial between 2007 and 2011 in rural northwest Bangladesh. Based on self-report of complications, women were categorized as having obstetric complications, near misses, or non-complicated pregnancies using definitions modified from the World Health Organization. Multivariable multinomial regression was used to analyze the association of biological, socioeconomic, and psychosocial variables with obstetric complications or near misses.Results: Of enrolled women, 25% (n = 10,380) were classified as having at least one obstetric complication, 2% (n = 1,004) with reported near misses, and 73% (n = 30,830) with non-complicated pregnancies. Twelve percent (n = 5,232) reported hemorrhage and 8% (n = 3,259) reported sepsis. Of the 27,241 women with live births or stillbirths, 11% (n = 2,950) reported obstructed labor and 1% (n = 328) reported eclampsia. Biological risk factors including women's age less than 18 years (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR] 1.26 95%CI:1.14-1.39) and greater than 35 years (RRR 1.23 95%CI:1.09-1.38), history of stillbirth or miscarriage (RRR 1.15 95%CI:1.07-1.22), and nulliparity (RRR 1.16 95%CI:1.02-1.29) significantly increased the risk of obstetric complications. Neither partner wanting the pregnancy increased the risk of obstetric complications (RRR 1.33 95%CI:1.20-1.46). Mid-upper arm circumference <21.5 cm increased the risk of hemorrhage and sepsis.Conclusions: These analyses indicate a high burden of obstetric morbidity. Maternal age, nulliparity, a history of miscarriage or stillbirth, and lack of pregnancy wantedness were associated with increased risk of obstetric complications. Policies to address early marriage, unmet need for contraception, and maternal undernutrition may help mitigate this morbidity burden in rural Bangladesh. © 2014 Sikder et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"trace element; abdominal bleeding; adolescent; adult; arm circumference; Article; Bangladesh; controlled study; eclampsia; female; human; induced abortion; live birth; major clinical study; maternal morbidity; medical history; nullipara; postpartum hemorrhage; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal care; prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; rural population; self report; sepsis; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; world health organization; adverse effects; chi square distribution; cohort analysis; evaluation study; home delivery; India; maternal mortality; multivariate analysis; newborn; obstetric delivery; Obstetric Labor Complications; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; pregnancy outcome; procedures; prospective study; risk factor; socioeconomics; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; trends; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Bangladesh; Chi-Square Distribution; Cohort Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Home Childbirth; Humans; India; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Maternal Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",,,14712393,,BPCMB,25282340,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907923964

These war neuroses were a response to the highly-industrialised nature of the warfare as well as to the fatigue engendered over four years of intense conflict. Yet while fear and mental breakdown were universal, national responses varied. A comparison of British and Belgian shell shock indicates that men suffered in very similar ways but that symptoms met with rather different responses: in Britain treatment and diagnostic regimes stressed the importance of class difference and shell shock was often linked to cowardice. These issues were not of overriding importance in the Belgian army. In the longer term shell shock became, and remained, a topic of political and social concern in Britain whereas in Belgium men suffering from kloppe (extreme fear) tended to be forgotten and the topic has not excited much popular interest or scholarly attention. Yet despite these differences one overarching theme remains clear, namely that despite the extensive experience of war neuroses during and after the First World War, there still remains a fierce stigma about the mental wounds of war. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","Kloppe; psychiatry; psychology; shell shock; war neuroses","Belgium; history; human; male; military medicine; posttraumatic stress disorder; United Kingdom; war; Belgium; Combat Disorders; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Military Psychiatry; World War I",,,13623699,,,25441306,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918537286

In it, we reveal how the field of orthopaedics became integral to military medicine by tracing the evolution of the discipline and its practitioners in each nation during the war. In doing so, however, we document not only when and why both medical specialists and military officials realized that maintaining their respective national fighting forces depended upon the efficient rehabilitation of wounded soldiers, but also how these rehabilitative practices and goals reflected the particularities of the military context, civilian society and social structure of each nation. Thus, while our comparison reveals a number of similarities in the orthopaedic developments within each nation as a response to the Great War, we also reveal significant national differences in war-time medical goals, rehabilitation treatments and soldierly ‘medical experiences’. Moreover, as we demonstrate, a social and cultural re-conceptualization of the disabled body accompanied the medical advancements developed for him; however, this re-conceptualization was not the same in each nation. Thus, what our article reveals is that although the guns of August fell silent in 1918, the war’s medical experiences lingered long thereafter shaping the future of disability medicine in both nations. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","disability; Germany; Great Britain; military medicine; orthopaedics; rehabilitation","Germany; history; human; military medicine; orthopedics; rehabilitation; United Kingdom; war; Wounds and Injuries; Germany; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Medicine; Orthopedics; Rehabilitation; World War I; Wounds and Injuries",,,13623699,,,25486223,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918520837

Yet, they have also been criticised for their negative impact on country health systems. In response, disease-specific GHIs have, somewhat paradoxically, appropriated the aim of health system strengthening (HSS). This article critically analyses this development through an ethnographic case study of the GAVI Alliance, which funds vaccines in poor countries. Despite GAVI's self-proclaimed ‘single-minded’ focus on vaccines, HSS support is fronted as a key principle of GAVI's mission. Yet, its meaning remains unclear and contested understandings of the health systems agenda abound, reflecting competing public health ideologies and professional pressures within the global health field. Contrary to broader conceptualisations of HSS that emphasise social and political dimensions, GAVI's HSS support has become emblematic of the so-called ‘Gates approach’ to global health, focused on targeted technical solutions with clear, measurable outcomes.

We analyze the institutionalization of this branch of genetics in the 1950s and 1960s, and look at research on the characteristics of the population of Brazil, which made use of new explanatory models of evolutionary dynamics. These developments were greatly influenced by the activities of the Rockefeller Foundation and by the presence of North American geneticists in Brazil, especially Theodosius Dobzhansky. One of the main points of this paper is to show that explanations of Brazilian human genetic diversity constructed in the mid-twentieth century closely followed interpretations that had been produced since the end of the nineteenth century, in which notions of 'racial mixing' played a central role. Even as population genetics was conditioned by nationalist concerns that had long marked Brazilian history, we argue that its emergence and institutionalization was closely associated with global, post-World War II socio-political contexts, especially with regards to modernization projects and growing scientific internationalization. © 2014 The Authors.","Brazil; Evolutionary theory; History of genetics; Latin America; Physical anthropology; Racial crossing","ancestry group; Brazil; genetic variability; history; human; population genetics; research; science; social change; war; Brazil; Continental Population Groups; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Research; Science; Social Change; World War II",,,13698486,,,24954151,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910076823

In this system, known and as yet unknown constituents of blood were positioned as relevant to the work of multiple constituencies including human population geneticists, physical anthropologists, and immunologists. To facilitate serving these and other constituencies, it was crucial to standardize practices of collecting and preserving samples of blood from globally distributed human populations. The WHO achieved this by linking its administrative infrastructure-comprised of expert advisory groups and technical reports-to key laboratories, which served as sites for demonstrating and also for disseminating standards for working with variable blood samples. The practices that were articulated in making blood samples into a flexible resource contributes to emerging histories of global health that highlight the centrality of new institutions, like the WHO, new forms of expertise, like population genetics and serological epidemiology, and new kinds of research materials, like frozen blood. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Epidemiological intelligence; Population genetics; Population health; Serological epidemiology; Serum banking; World Health Organization","blood; blood sampling; freezing; health care planning; history; human; laboratory; research; war; world health organization; Blood; Blood Specimen Collection; Freezing; Health Resources; History, 20th Century; Humans; Laboratories; Research; World Health Organization; World War II",,,13698486,,,25066899,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910041764

Infant and maternal mortality rates continued to fall, new drugs became available, and efforts were made to improve the health of mothers and babies through the provision of subsidised milk and other foodstuffs. However, in return, women were also expected to contribute to the war effort through motherhood, and this reflected wider cultural ideas in the North Atlantic world in the first half of the twentieth century which equated maternity with military service. The aim of this article is to examine the interplay between narratives of birth and narratives of war in the accounts of maternity from women of the wartime generation. It will explore how the military-maternity analogy sheds light on women's experiences of pregnancy and childbirth in Britain during the Second World War, whilst also considering maternity within women's wider role as 'domestic soldiers', contributing to the war effort through their traditional work as housewives and mothers. In doing so, the article reveals the complexity of women's narratives. It demonstrates that they do not simply conform to the 'medical vs. social' binary, but reflect the wider cultural context in which women gave birth. Women incorporated the dominant discourses of the period, namely those around war, into their accounts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Britain; Maternity; Narrative; Second World War","birth; cultural anthropology; female; gender identity; history; human; mother; pregnancy; social behavior; soldier; United Kingdom; war; warfare; work; Culture; Female; Gender Identity; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Personnel; Mothers; Parturition; Pregnancy; Social Responsibility; Warfare; Work; World War II",,,13698486,,,24361165,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910049590

Using sources from several collecting projects, I follow how blood was encountered, how it was inscribed, and how it was turned into a laboratory resource. I trace Mourant's analytical and representational strategies to make blood groups both credibly 'genetic' and understood as relevant to human ancestry, race and history. In this story, 'populations' were not simply given, but were produced through public health, colonial and post-colonial institutions, and by the labour and expertise of subjects, assistants and mediators.

Lisker's surveys of blood group types, and of G6PD (glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase) and hemoglobin variants in indigenous populations, incorporated linguistic criteria in the sampling methods, and historical and cultural anthropological accounts in the interpretation of results. In doing so, Lisker heavily relied on the discourse and the infrastructure created by the indigenista program and its institutions. Simultaneously, Lisker's research was thoroughly supported by international and bilateral agencies and programs, including the malaria eradication campaign of the 1950s and 1960s. As a member of the scientific elite he was able to make original contributions to the postwar field of human population genetics.

A recent study concluded that since 1924 in the United States alone, vaccines have prevented 40 million cases of diphtheria, 35 million cases of measles, and a total of 103 million cases of childhood diseases. A report from the World Health Organization states that today vaccines prevent 2.5 million deaths per year: Every minute five lives are saved by vaccines worldwide. Overall, vaccines have done and continue to do an excellent job in eliminating or reducing the impact of childhood diseases. Furthermore, thanks to new technologies, vaccines now have the potential to make an enormous contribution to the health of modern society by preventing and treating not only communicable diseases in all ages, but also noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The achievement of these results requires the development of novel technologies and health economic models able to capture not only the mere cost- benefit of vaccination, but also the value of health per se.","Adjuvants; Cost-effectiveness; Immunotherapy; Life expectancy; Reverse vaccinology","vaccine; cancer vaccine; vaccine; age distribution; cancer prevention; cancer therapy; childhood disease; communicable disease; cost effectiveness analysis; death; degenerative disease; groups by age; health economics; human; immune system; infection; infection control; infection prevention; life expectancy; medical history; medical society; medical technology; non communicable disease; priority journal; review; vaccination; world health organization; communicable disease control; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; cost benefit analysis; economics; isolation and purification; Neoplasms; Neurodegenerative Diseases; poverty; procedures; social status; synthetic biology; trends; vaccination; Cancer Vaccines; Communicable Disease Control; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Life Expectancy; Neoplasms; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Poverty; Social Conditions; Synthetic Biology; Vaccination; Vaccines",,,00278424,,PNASA,25136130,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906658966

Emerging diseases are often suspected to be driven by increased virulence or fitness, possibly associated with the gain of novel genes or mutations. However, the time period over which humans have been afflicted by such diseases is only known for very few bacterial pathogens, and the evidence for recently increased virulence or fitness is scanty. Has Darwinian (diversifying) selection at the genomic level recently driven microevolution within bacterial pathogens of humans? Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A is a major cause of enteric fever, with a microbiological history dating to 1898. We identified seven modern lineages among 149 genomes on the basis of 4,584 SNPs in the core genome and estimated that Paratyphi A originated 450 y ago. During that time period, the effective population size has undergone expansion, reduction, and recent expansion. Mutations, some of which inactivate genes, have occurred continuously over the history of Paratyphi A, as has the gain or loss of accessory genes. We also identified 273 mutations that were under Darwinian selection. However, most genetic changes are transient, continuously being removed by purifying selection, and the genome of Paratyphi A has not changed dramatically over centuries. We conclude that Darwinian selection is not responsible for increased frequency of enteric fever and suggest that environmental changes may be more important for the frequency of disease.","Historical reconstruction; Pathogen evolution; Phylogeography","article; bacterial transmission; darwinian selection; gene inactivation; gene loss; gene mutation; genetic identification; genetic selection; genome; history of medicine; nonhuman; population size; priority journal; purifying selection; Salmonella enterica; Salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi a; serotype; single nucleotide polymorphism; typhoid fever; historical reconstruction; pathogen evolution; phylogeography; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Salmonella enterica; Selection, Genetic; Typhoid Fever; World Health",,,00278424,,PNASA,25092320,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906309033

The Millennium Development Goals established global targets for drinking water and sanitation access; progress towards these targets, facilitated by international monitoring, has contributed to reducing the global disease burden and increasing quality of life. The experiences of the MDG period generated important lessons about the strengths and limitations of current approaches to defining and monitoring access to drinking water and sanitation. The methods by which the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF tracks access and progress are based on analysis of data from household surveys and linear regression modelling of these results over time. These methods provide nationally representative and internationally comparable insights into the drinking water and sanitation facilities used by populations worldwide, but also have substantial limitations: current methods do not address water quality, equity of access, or extra-household services. Improved statistical methods are needed to better model temporal trends. This article describes and critically reviews JMP methods in detail for the first time. It also explores the impact of, and future directions for, international monitoring of drinking water and sanitation. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","International; JMP; MDG; Method; Millennium; Monitoring; Sanitation; UNICEF; Water; WHO","drinking water; drinking water; Millenium Development Goal; monitoring; sanitation; water quality; water supply; World Health Organization; environmental monitoring; environmental sanitation; government regulation; household; linear regression analysis; protocol compliance; quality of life; review; rural area; standardization; trend study; urban area; water management; water quality; water supply; history; international cooperation; sanitation; United Nations; world health organization; Environmental Monitoring; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; International Cooperation; Sanitation; United Nations; Water Supply; World Health Organization",,,16617827,,,25116635,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84917691911

However, few studies have investigated biodiversity in landscapes with similar physical properties but governed by different political systems. Here we investigate land use and biodiversity patterns, and number and composition of birds and plants, in the borderland of Austria, Slovenia and Hungary. It is a physically uniform landscape but managed differently during the last 70 years as a consequence of the political ""map"" of Europe after World War I and II. We used a historical map from 1910 and satellite data to delineate land use within three 10-kilometre transects starting from the point where the three countries meet. There was a clear difference between countries detectable in current biodiversity patterns, which relates to land use history. Mobile species richness was associated with current land use whereas diversity of sessile species was more associated with past land use. Heterogeneous landscapes were positively and forest cover was negatively correlated to bird species richness.

His teachings incorporated much of the ancient Greek traditions including the work of Hippocrates and Aristotle. Galen himself was a well-educated Greco-Roman physician and physiologist who at one time was a physician to the gladiators in Pergamon. Later he moved to Rome, where he was associated with the Roman emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. The Galenical school was responsible for voluminous writings, many of which are still extant. One emphasis was on the humors of the body, which were believed to be important in disease. Another was the cardiopulmonary system, including the belief that part of the blood from the right ventricle could enter the left through the interventricular septum. An extraordinary feature of these teachings is that they dominated thinking for some 1,300 years and became accepted as dogma by both the State and Church. One of the first anatomists to challenge the Galenical teachings was Andreas Vesalius, who produced a magnificent atlas of human anatomy in 1543. At about the same time Michael Servetus described the pulmonary transit of blood, but he was burned at the stake for heresy. Finally, with William Harvey and others in the first part of the 17th century, the beginnings of modern physiology emerged with an emphasis on hypotheses and experimental data. Nevertheless, vestiges of Galen's teaching survived into the 19th century. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.","Ancient Greeks; Body humors; Cardiopulmonary system; Harvey; Vesalius","ancient Greeks; body humors; cardiopulmonary system; Harvey; Vesalius; History, Ancient; Humans; Physiology; Respiratory Physiological Phenomena; Roman World",,,10400605,,APLPE,24879053,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904285892

Following his suggestion, Beck started experimental studies on the electrical brain activity of animals, especially in response to sensory stimulation. Beck placed electrodes directly on the surface of brain to localize brain potentials that were evoked by sensory stimuli. He observed spontaneous fluctuations in the electrical brain activity and noted that these oscillations ceased after sensory stimulation. He published these findings concerning the electrical brain activity, such as spontaneous fluctuations, evoked potentials, and desynchronization of brain waves, in 1890 in the German language Centralblatt für Physiologie. Moreover, an intense polemic arose between physiologists of that era on the question of who should claim being the founder of electroencephalography. Ultimately, Richard Caton from Liverpool showed that he had performed similar experiments in monkeys years earlier. Nevertheless, Beck added new elements to the nature of electrical brain activity. In retrospect, next to Richard Caton, Adolf Beck can be regarded, together with Hans Berger who later introduced the method to humans, as one of the founders of electroencephalography. Soon after his success, Beck got a chair at the Department of Physiology of the University at Lemberg, now Lviv National Medical University. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Adolf Beck; desynchronization; electrocorticography; electroencephalography; evoked potential; Hans Berger; Jagiellonian University; Napoleon Cybulski; Richard Caton; spontaneous oscillations; University of Lemberg","art; electroencephalography; history; human; physiology; Poland; war; Electroencephalography; History, 19th Century; Humans; Physiology; Poland; World War I",,,0964704X,,JHNEF,24735457,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904541963

For example, the new focus on total atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) is now inclusive of stroke in addition to hard coronary events, and there are now separate equations to facilitate estimation of risk in non-Hispanic white and black individuals and separate equations for women. Physicians may now estimate lifetime risk in addition to 10-year risk. Despite this progress, the new risk equations do not appear to lead to significantly better discrimination than older models. Because the exact same risk factors are incorporated, using the new risk estimators may lead to inaccurate assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in special groups such as younger individuals with unique ASCVD risk factors. In general, there appears to be an overestimation of risk when applied to modern populations with greater use of preventive therapy, although the magnitude of overestimation remains unclear. Because absolute risk estimates are directly used for treatment decisions in the new cholesterol guidelines, these issues could result in overuse of pharmacologic management. The guidelines could provide clearer direction on which individuals would benefit from additional testing, such as coronary calcium scores, for more personalized preventive therapies. We applaud the advances of these new guidelines, and we aim to critically appraise the applicability of the risk assessment tools so that future iterations of the estimators can be improved to more accurately assess risk in individual patients. © 2014 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Despite WHO recommendations for active case finding among people who inject drugs (PWID), few studies have been published. The historical focus of case finding has been in populations that are human immunodeficiency virus-positive, incarcerated or at higher occupational risk. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the yield of active case finding among PWID newly started on methadone in Tanzania. DESIGN: Of 222 methadone clients, 156 (70%) met with study administrators; 150 consented to participate, 139 (93%) of whom were male. The median age was 34 years. A symptom-based questionnaire was developed by the investigators and administered to every consenting patient by a native Swahili speaker. RESULTS: Of the 150 patients surveyed, 16 (11%) had one or more TB symptoms and were referred for laboratory testing. Six new TB cases were identified in this active case finding program, with a prevalence of 4%. CONCLUSION: This study presents the first data on TB prevalence in a population of PWID in Tanzania.

Secondary data analysis was performed for 12 European countries using data, including PTSD prevalence and number of war victims, crime victims, and natural disaster victims, from different sources. Ten single value orientations, as well as value aggregates for traditional and modern factors, were investigated. Results: Whilst differences in PTSD prevalence were strongly associated with war victim rates, associations, albeit weaker, were also found between crime victims and PTSD. When cultural value orientations, such as stimulation and conformity as representatives of modern and traditional values, were included in the multivariate predictions of PTSD prevalence, an average of approximately 80% of PTSD variance could be explained by the model, independent of the type of trauma exposure. Conclusion: The results suggest that the aftermath of war contributes to current PTSD prevalence, which may be explained by the high proportion of the older population who directly or indirectly experienced traumatic war experiences. Additional findings for other types of civil trauma point towards an interaction between value orientation and country-specific trauma rates. Particularly, being personally oriented towards stimulation appears to interact with differences in trauma prevalence. Thus, cultural value orientation might be viewed not only as an individual intrinsic process but also as a compensatory strategy after trauma exposure. © 2014 Burri and Maercker; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cross-cultural assessment; Cultural values; Mental disorder; Post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD; Societies; War trauma; World War II","crime victim; disaster victim; Europe; history; human; prevalence; psychology; social psychology; socioeconomics; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; war; Crime Victims; Disaster Victims; Europe; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Prevalence; Social Values; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Value of Life; World War II",,,17560500,,,24972489,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902889713

Breastfeeding provides health benefits, but it is not known whether or how breastfeeding decreases the risk of developing asthma. We performed a systematic review and meta-Analysis of studies published between 1983 and 2012 on breastfeeding and asthma in children from the general population. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. We grouped the outcomes into asthma ever, recent asthma, or recent wheezing illness (recent asthma or recent wheeze). Using random-effects meta-Analyses, we estimated pooled odds ratios of the association of breastfeeding with the risk for each of these outcomes. We performed meta-regression and stratified meta-Analyses. We included 117 of 1,464 titles identified by our search. The pooled odds ratios were 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.84) for 75 studies analyzing asthma ever, 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 0.86) for 46 studies analyzing recent asthma, and 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.87) for 94 studies analyzing recent wheezing illness. After stratification by age, the strong protective association found at ages 0-2 years diminished over time. We found no evidence for differences by study design or study quality or between studies in Western and non-Western countries. A positive association of breastfeeding with reduced asthma/wheezing is supported by the combined evidence of existing studies. © 2014 The Author 2014.

T. delbrueckii is thus a remarkable ubiquitous yeast species with both wild and anthropic habitats, and appears to be a perfect yeast model to search for evidence of human domestication. For that purpose, we developed eight microsatellite markers that were used for the genotyping of 110 strains from various substrates and geographical origins. Microsatellite analysis showed four genetic clusters: two groups contained most nature strains from Old World and Americas respectively, and two clusters were associated with winemaking and other bioprocesses. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) confirmed that human activities significantly shaped the genetic variability of T. delbrueckii species. Natural isolates are differentiated on the basis of geographical localisation, as expected for wild population. The domestication of T. delbrueckii probably dates back to the Roman Empire for winemaking (∼1900 years ago), and to the Neolithic era for bioprocesses (∼4000 years ago). Microsatellite analysis also provided valuable data regarding the life-cycle of the species, suggesting a mostly diploid homothallic life. In addition to population genetics and ecological studies, the microsatellite tool will be particularly useful for further biotechnological development of T. delbrueckii strains for winemaking and other bioprocesses. © 2014 Albertin et al.",,"article; bioprocess; controlled study; diploidy; domestication; food microbiotechnology; food processing; fungal life cycle stage; fungal strain; gene cluster; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; geographical variation (species); microsatellite marker; nonhuman; strain identification; Torulaspora; winemaking; Africa; Asia; classification; cultural anthropology; Europe; food control; genetic variability; genetics; genotyping technique; growth, development and aging; history; human; inbreeding; microbiology; ploidy; procedures; restriction fragment length polymorphism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; species difference; Torulaspora; Vitis; Western Hemisphere; wine; fungal DNA; microsatellite DNA; Africa; Americas; Asia; DNA, Fungal; Europe; Food Microbiology; Genetic Variation; Genotyping Techniques; History, Ancient; Humans; Inbreeding; Industrial Microbiology; Microsatellite Repeats; Ploidies; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Roman World; Species Specificity; Torulaspora; Vitis; Wine",,,19326203,,POLNC,24718638,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899558896

Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence that screening for elder abuse reduces harm, physicians in most states have professional and legal obligations to appropriately diagnose, report, and refer persons who have been abused. Screening or systematic inquiry can detect abuse. A detailed medical evaluation of patients suspected of being abused is necessary because medical and psychiatric conditions can mimic abuse. Signs of abuse may include specific patterns of injury. Interviewing patients and caregivers separately is helpful. Evaluation for possible abuse should include assessment of cognitive function.

Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, and Dutch prime minister Hendrikus Colijn-found for the challenges that sound amplification and radio created for their rhetoric and presentation. Taking their different political styles into account, the article demonstrates that the interconnected technologies of sound amplification and radio forced a transition from a spellbinding style based on atmosphere and pathos in a virtual environment to ""political crooning"" that created artificial intimacy in despatialized simultaneity. Roosevelt and Colijn created the best examples of this political crooning, while Churchill and Hitler encountered problems in this respect. Churchill's radio successes profited from the special circumstances during the first period of World War II. Hitler's speeches were integrated into a radio regime trying to shape, with dictatorial powers, a national socialistic community of listeners. © 2014 by the Society for the History of Technology.

During the following decade, legislatures in different municipal and state governments moved trans fat regulation forward, whereas many food companies decided to independently phase out trans fat in their products. The advancement of these parallel processes suggests an emerging best practices phenomenon, integrating public health, law, and the food industry.

Framed in terms of self-development, citizenship took on a broad meaning, not just in terms of political rights and obligations, but also in the context of material, social, psychological and moral conditions that individuals should meet in order to develop themselves and be able to act according to those rights and obligations in a responsible way. In the post-war period of reconstruction (1945-65), as well as between 1965 and 1985, the link between mental health and ideals of citizenship was coloured by the public memory of World War II and the German occupation, albeit in completely different, even opposite ways. The memory of the war, and especially the public consideration of its victims, changed drastically in the mid-1960s, and the mental health sector played a crucial role in bringing this change about. The widespread attention to the mental effects of the war that surfaced in the late 1960s after a period of 20 years of public silence should be seen against the backdrop of the combination of democratization and the emancipation of emotions. © The Author(s) 2013.","20th century; Citizenship; democracy; memory; mental health; Netherlands; psychiatry; self-development; World War II","20th century; article; citizenship; history; human; memory; mental health; Netherlands; political system; psychiatry; psychological aspect; self-development; survivor; war; 20th century; Citizenship; democracy; memory; mental health; Netherlands; psychiatry; self-development; World War II; Democracy; History, 20th Century; Humans; Mental Health; Netherlands; Psychiatry; Survivors; World War II",,,0957154X,,,24594819,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897690138

Sforza 28, 20122 Milan, Italy","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has important heritable components. In the past 20 years, knowledge in this field has greatly increased with the identification of a number of gene variants causing hypercoagulability. The two main mechanisms are loss-of-function of anticoagulant proteins and gain-of-function of procoagulants, the latter owing to increased synthesis or impaired downregulation of a normal protein or, more rarely, to synthesis of a functionally hyperactive molecule. Diagnosis of thrombophilia is useful to determine the causes of VTE, recognizing that this multifactorial disease can also be influenced by various acquired factors including cancer, surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization, or reproduction-associated risk factors. Diagnosis of inherited thrombophilia rarely affects the acute or long-term management of VTE. However, the risk of recurrent VTE is increased in anticoagulant-deficient patients and in homozygotes for gain-of-function mutations. Screening for inherited thrombophilia in thrombosis-free individuals is indicated only for relatives of a proband who is anticoagulant-deficient or has a family history of VTE. In families with thrombophilia and VTE, primary antithrombotic prophylaxis during risk situations lowers the rate of incident VTE. In this Review, we discuss the main causes of inherited thrombophilia, the associated clinical manifestations, and the implications for antithrombotic prophylaxis in the affected individuals. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It affects mainly young adults and arises in the midline, primarily involving the cerebellum, and the walls or floor of the fourth ventricle. The tumor is composed of distinctive histological components, uniform neurocytes forming rosettes and (or) perivascular pseudorosettes, as well as astrocytic component resembling pilocytic astrocytoma. To our best knowledge, no more than 50 cases of RGNT have been described in the literatures to date and found commonly in association with the ventricular system. Only a few cases have been known to occur at sites outside of its usual location. Herein, we present a rare case of RGNT of brain parenchyma. Due to its rarity and non-specific appearance in radiological examination, it is a diagnostic challenge for radiologists and histopathologists to differentiate RGNT in unusual sites from other intracranial lesions because of its similarities in radiological and histological findings. The aim of this study is to summarize the clinicopathological features of RGNT and discuss the differential diagnosis of histologically similar tumors in brain. Methods: The clinical manifestation of a patient with RGNT occurring in left frontal lobe was presented retrospectively. Resected mass was routinely paraffin-embedded and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Dako EnVision immunohistochemical staining system was used to detect the tumor antigen expressions, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 protein (S-100), cytokeratin (CK), neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), synaptophysin (Syn), neuron - specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A (CgA), oligodendrocytes transcription factor-2 (Olig-2), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and Ki-67 (MIB- 1). Results: A 12 - year - old girl presented with 2 - year history of twitches and mild headache. MRI revealed a solid well-circumscribed lesion in left frontal lobe with mild heterogeneous enhancement. The lesion was observed to locate in brain parenchyma and there was no evidence of tumor infiltrating in ventricular system. Craniotomy was performed and the tumor was removed totally. Histological examination revealed that the tumor was distinctive in its juxtaposition of patterned neurocytic and pilocytic astroglial components. The neurocytic component showed the tumor cells had small, uniform round nuclei with scant cytoplasm and formed narrow perivascular pseudorosettes or Homer-Wright-like rosettes arrays of neurocytic nuclei around delicate eosinophilic neuropil cores. The glial component tended to exhibit pilocytic astrocytoma - like morphology with long, hair - like processes and Rosenthal fibers. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells in glial component were diffusely positive for GFAP and S-100, but negative for NeuN, Syn and NSE. However, perivascular pseudorosettes or Homer-Wright-like rosettes were positive for Syn and Olig-2, and negative for GFAP. Ki-67 index was low and less than 1%. Based on clinical presentation and histological findings, a final histological diagnosis of RGNT in brain parenchyma, WHO grade -, was made according to the criteria of WHO classification. The patient has not received chemotherapy and attended follow-up for 12 months, without any neurological deficit or signs of recurrence. Conclusions: RGNT is a rare tumor and classified as mixed neuronal-glial tumor. RGNT probably derives from a common progenitor cell originated from subependymal plate or brain parenchyma, able to differentiate toward both glial and neuronal phenotype. RGNT in brain parenchyma is also observed to have the similar biological behaviors and histopathological characteristics with its intra - ventricular counterpart. With similarities in histological findings, it may be difficult to differentiate RGNT from extraventricular neurocytoma, dysembry oplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), and ependymoma with neuronal differentiation or neuropil-like islands. The presence of distinct low-grade glial component in the tumor and appropriate immunohistochemical profile are necessary for correct diagnosis.","Brain neoplasms; Immunohistochemistry; Neuroglia; Neurons; Pathology","cell nucleus antigen; chromogranin A; cytokeratin; eosin; epithelial membrane antigen; glial fibrillary acidic protein; hematoxylin; Ki 67 antigen; neuron specific enolase; oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2; paraffin; protein S 100; synaptophysin; tumor antigen; antigen expression; article; brain; brain parenchyma; brain tumor; cancer patient; case report; child; clinical feature; craniotomy; differential diagnosis; female; follow up; frontal lobe; headache; histology; human; immunohistochemistry; medical history; muscle twitch; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pilocytic astrocytoma; retrospective study; rosette forming glioneuronal tumor; school child; tumor cell; world health organization",,,16726731,,,,"Chinese",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898478403

Its dome, covering the whole building, has a diameter of 65.0 m and in the year it was completed was the largest reinforced concrete dome in the world. This broke the previous record, held by the dome of the Pantheon in Rome (43.3 m), which had lasted for 1787 years. This paper describes the structure of the building, its condition after 100 years of use and the renovation works carried out in 2009-2011. An important part of the renovation was strengthening the lower (tension) ring of the ribbed dome by way of external prestressing. Details concerning the assessment of the technical condition of the hall, numerical calculations and the proposed system of strengthening are presented.

Although native to Africa, bottle gourd was in use by humans in east Asia, possibly as early as 11,000 y ago (BP) and in the Americas by 10,000 BP. Despite its utilitarian importance to diverse human populations, it remains unresolved how the bottle gourd came to be so widely distributed, and in particular how and when it arrived in the New World. A previous study using ancient DNA concluded that Paleoindians transported already domesticated gourds to the Americas from Asia when colonizing the New World [Erickson et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102 (51):18315-18320]. However, this scenario requires the propagation of tropical-adapted bottle gourds across the Arctic. Here, we isolate 86,000 base pairs of plastid DNA from a geographically broad sample of archaeological and living bottle gourds. In contrast to the earlier results, we find that all pre-Columbian bottle gourds are most closely related to African gourds, not Asian gourds. Ocean-current drift modeling shows that wild African gourds could have simply floated across the Atlantic during the Late Pleistocene. Once they arrived in the New World, naturalized gourd populations likely became established in the Neotropics via dispersal by megafaunal mammals. These wild populations were domesticated in several distinct New World locales, most likely near established centers of food crop domestication.","Archaeogenomics; Long-distance dispersal; New world domestication","Africa; article; Asia; Asian; chloroplast; Cucurbitaceae; domestication; horizontal gene transfer; indel mutation; Lagenaria siceraria; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; North America; phylogeny; plant genetics; plastid genome; priority journal; archaeogenomics; long-distance dispersal; New World domestication; Africa; Agriculture; Americas; Asia; Base Sequence; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Cucurbitaceae; Demography; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Plastids; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Movements",,,00278424,,PNASA,24516122,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896810700

Though couched in the language of pluralism, Hick's later work in the philosophy of religion functions apologetically to maintain a version of the religious-secular distinction that, while theologically and politically loaded, is, I show, philosophically arbitrary.

However, over the past decade, the organization has to some extent been bypassed for funding, and it lost some of its authority and its ability to set a global health agenda. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. Some of the main factors include WHO's inability to reform its core structure, the growing influence of non-governmental actors, a lack of coherence in the positions, priorities and funding decisions between the health ministries and the ministries overseeing development assistance in several donor member states, and the lack of strong leadership of the organization. © 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.","Global Health Governance; History of global health; The World Health Organization","Cold War; governance approach; health worker; historical perspective; organizational change; post-war; public health; World Health Organization; clinical practice; funding; government regulation; health care availability; health care financing; health care planning; health care quality; human; leadership; political participation; public health; public-private partnership; review; social status; world health organization; Global Health Governance; History of global health; The World Health Organization; Health Priorities; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; International Cooperation; Leadership; World Health; World Health Organization",,,00333506,,PUHEA,24388640,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892785405

The article elaborates on the views attributed to Hippocrates (d. ca. 375 BC), which received attention from both Muslim physicians, such as Avicenna (d. 1037), and their Jewish peers living in the Muslim world including Ibn Jumay' (d. ca. 1198) and Moses Maimonides (d. 1204). The religio-ethical implications of these Graeco-Islamic-Jewish embryological views were fathomed out by the two medieval Muslim jurists Shihāb al-Dīn al-Qarāfī (d. 1285) and Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 1350). By putting these medieval religio-ethical discussions into the limelight, the article aims to argue for a two-pronged thesis. Firstly, pre-modern medical ethics did exist in the Islamic tradition and available evidence shows that this field had a multidisciplinary character where the Islamic scriptures and the Graeco-Islamic-Jewish medical legacy were highly intertwined. This information problematizes the postulate claiming that medieval Muslim jurists were hostile to the so-called 'ancient sciences'. Secondly, these medieval religio-ethical discussions remain playing a significant role in shaping the nascent field of contemporary Islamic bioethics.

Degree distribution showed the long-tail characteristics from 1952 and 1962, and then turned to a scale-free network. The degree-degree correlation shows as an inverse-U pattern, which is affected by complicated factors such as distance, technology, and economic elements.

Dominant representations of Soviet psychology and some of the main Soviet authors are revisited in the light of a blending of facts actively associated with their emergence in both Soviet and Western psychology. From the beginning, Soviet psychology was founded upon Marxism. However, the ways by which that psychology pretended to become Marxist in its philosophical basis were diverse and often contradictory. Other philosophical and theoretical positions also influenced Soviet psychologists. Different moments of that contradictory process are discussed in this article, and through this, I bring to light their interrelations and the consequences for the development of Soviet psychology. This article reinterprets several myths found within Soviet psychology, in which different theoretical representations have become institutionalized for long periods in both Soviet and Western psychology. Particular attention is given to identifying the conditions that presented Vygotsky, Luria, and Leontiev as part of the same paradigm, and which paved the way for a perception of Leontiev and his group as paralleling Vygotsky's importance among American psychologists. Many of the sources that are used in this article were published in Soviet psychology only after the 1970s. Unlike the different and interesting works that began to appear on diverse trends in Soviet psychology, this article details in depth the articulation of topics and questions that still now are presented as different chapters in the analysis of Soviet psychology. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Activity theory; Consciousness; Cultural-historical approach; Idealistic russian psycholoyg; Soviet psychology","article; comparative study; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; history; human; ideology; political system; psychological theory; psychology; publishing; science; United States; USSR; Communism; Cross-Cultural Comparison; History, 20th Century; Humans; Psychological Theory; Psychology; Publishing; Science; Socialism; United States; USSR; Western World",,,10934510,,,24548071,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894248165

Rogers's ""client-centered"" methods of personal adjustment counseling, and the 400- plus college counseling centers created by the Veterans Administration to provide the educational-vocational counseling benefit promised to returning World War II servicemen under the 1944 GI Bill, these counseling psychologists created a new place to practice where important currents in psychology, higher education, and federal policy converged and where they attempted to integrate educational-vocational counseling with personal adjustment counseling based on techniques from psychotherapy.

Here, we describe the same from a centre in North India. Methods: Retrospective data regarding medical history, physical examination, complete blood count, bone marrow aspirate, and biopsy were retrieved for all children <18 years, with acquired AA admitted between January 2005 and June 2012. In addition, the outcome data after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or bone marrow transplant (BMT) was obtained. Results: A total of 61 children were diagnosed with AA (Inherited-18 and acquired-43). Among 43 children with acquired AA, 3 had nonsevere and 40 had severe. One patient with nonsevere AA died of sepsis and 2 recovered spontaneously. Of the 40 remaining children with severe AA, 10 refused therapy and 3 died due to severe sepsis prior to any therapy. Five underwent upfront matched sibling donor BMT and one post-IST failure. Four year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for children undergoing BMT was 100% and 80 ± 17.9, respectively. Out of 22 treated with IST, 20 were evaluable for response. Seventeen received one course and 3 received two course of IST. The overall response to IST was seen in 14/20 (70%). Only two achieved complete response while remaining 12 had partial response. The 4-year estimated OS and EFS for children treated with IST was 74.4 ± 12.1% and 65.6 ± 12.2.

Using prices of and acreages planted with wheat, barley, and oats on manors held by the bishop of Winchester from 1325 to 1370, price elasticities of supply are estimated for each grain in aggregate and on each particular manor. Aggregate price elasticities of supply for wheat, barley, and oats were rarely statistically significant and when significant were very low compared with elasticities estimated for developing and developed countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The low levels of agricultural supply response in fourteenth-century England suggest that commercialization was not as dominant in the medieval economy as has been argued. Thus, structural changes in the economy, such as the leasing of demesnes, the growth of wage labour, and the end of villeinage, may have been more important than price fluctuations in driving long-run economic change after the Black Death. Likewise, a shift from low price responsiveness to higher price responsiveness could have been an important part of the capitalist transformation of agriculture in the early modern period. © Economic History Society 2013.",,"agricultural production; demand elasticity; developing world; economic history; historical perspective; nineteenth century; price determination; price dynamics; England; Hampshire; United Kingdom; Winchester; Avena; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",,,00130117,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892481017

Pastoralism occupies a fundamental economic, social and religious role in Andean life. Today, camelid livestock are confined to the ecozone of the puna (above 3,500 masl), while their presence on the Pacific coast during pre-Hispanic times is attested by archaeological skeletal remains. This study aims to document herding practices on the northern Peruvian coast during the Early Intermediate Period (200 BC-600 AD) by gaining insights into diet, location of breeding and mobility of archaeological camelids from the funerary and ritual contexts of two Mochica sites, Uhle Platform in Huacas de Moche and El Brujo. The three first early years and the long-term life histories of the animals were documented by the combined bulk analysis of bone collagen (δ13Ccol and δ15Ncol) and bone structural carbonate (δ13Cbone and δ18Obone) and the serial analysis of structural carbonate of molar tooth enamel (δ13Cenamel and δ18O enamel). Mochica camelids were bred in the low and/or middle valleys, unlike their modern counterparts, who are restricted to highland puna C 3 pastures. Archaeological camelids had diverse and complex life histories, usually with substantial maize foddering. An ontogenetic switch in diet and possible residential mobility during the course of life were identified for some specimens. Although the inference of geographic origin from δ18Obone and δ18Oenamel values was limited because of the lack of understanding of the influence of environmental and biological factors, tooth enamel analysis has great potential for exploring camelid herding practices and Andean pastoralism. Our study suggested that Mochica herders adapted their practices to the difficult lowland environment and that herding practices were varied and not restricted to breeding at higher altitudes. The role of maize in different aspects of the economic life of the Mochicas is also underlined. © 2014 Dufour et al.",,"carbonic acid; collagen; delta 13C; delta 15N; delta 18O; isotope; unclassified drug; animal behavior; animal food; animal husbandry; animal tissue; archeology; article; Artiodactyla; biodiversity; biology; bone structure; breeding; enamel; environmental factor; evolutionary adaptation; geographic origin; historical period; isotope analysis; Lama glama; life history; maize; Mochica period; movement (physiology); nonhuman; pastoralism; Peru; ritual; species translocation; Vicugna pacos; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Breeding; Camelids, New World; Fossils; Peru",,,19326203,,POLNC,24498136,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900327372

It outlines commonalities and differences across the British empire and compares the British situation with developments elsewhere. Mapping shifting attitudes to 'plunder' and 'preservation', it shows how imperialism and preservationism were mutually constitutive as preservation was increasingly promoted as an instrument of good governance. However, it also shows how, across the British empire, a rhetoric of imperial preservation masked the appropriation of indigenous knowledge by the imperialists, while imperial notions of heritage were subverted and reclaimed by the colonized. © The British Academy 2013.

To explain an event of such magnitude, it was understandable that historians should seek no less portentous origins with factors such as the rise of capitalism, class struggle or the impact of the Enlightenment cited as the long-term causes of Revolution. In recent years, however, there has been a preoccupation with the actual course of the Revolution. The prevailing concern with political culture and gender as analytical tools has illuminated developments in Paris and in the French provinces, and has brought to prominence many themes inadequately explored during earlier scholarly generations. Rather less attention is given currently to how France was plunged into revolutionary turmoil, which is now taken largely as a 'given'. This book by contrast focuses once again upon the origins of the dramatic events within and beyond France, which transformed later-eighteenth century Europe so comprehensively and established the terms of political and social struggle for the next two centuries.

Images engraved in Greco-Roman coinage range from references to the assassination of Caesar and legendary stories like the arrival of a snake shaped demi-god Aesculapius to save the Romans from the plague, to invocations of major deities including Apollo the physician or Ammon the protector. Development: Depicted with the horns of a ram, Ammon was adopted by the Greeks as an epithet of Zeus and later incorporated by the Romans as Jupiter. References to the cult of Ammon appear on tetradrachms minted for Alexander The Great and on provincial Roman coins struck under Claudius. It is thrilling to hold a coin depicting Marcus Aurelius with Salus on the reverse and think that it could have been handed to Galen in payment for his services. However, it is rare to find figures other than rulers on coins and the physician of Pergamum is no exception. Inspired by the Renaissance school of Padua, French anatomists in the Enlightenment (Garengeot in 1742 and Flurant in 1752) continued reviving ancient myths and named the curve-shaped-inner portion of the temporal lobe Ammon's horn. Outstanding scholars who studied this primitive structure of the brain included Lorente de Nó and his mentor Cajal, whose portrait appeared on fifty-pesetas notes issued in 1935. Conclusions: As primary sources of great archaeological and artistic value, Greco-Roman coins provide information about the origins of the myths and gods of classical antiquity and continue to inspire the arts and sciences to this day. © 2011 Sociedad Española de Neurología.","Ammon's horn; History of neurology; Medical coinage; Temporal lobe","Antiquity; archeology; Greece; history of medicine; horn; literature; neurology; ram (sheep); Short Survey; temporal lobe; anatomy and histology; Egypt; Greek world; hippocampus; history; human; leisure; literature; neuroanatomy; Roman world; Egypt; Greek World; Hippocampus; History, 18th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; Humans; Mythology; Neuroanatomy; Numismatics; Roman World; Temporal Lobe",,,02134853,,NERLE,22770681,"Spanish",Short Survey,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908236758

Rabies has a very rich history. Worldwide, dogs are the most important vector, whereas wild animals, especially bats, are the main threat to humans in North America. After a delay at the site of entry, rabies virus spreads through the nervous system by fast axonal transport. Rabies can be effectively prevented after a recognized animal exposure with wound cleansing and administration of rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin. Rabies typically develops after an incubation period of 20-90 days. Rabies has encephalitic and paralytic forms of disease and rabies is almost universally fatal after clinical onset. Hydrophobia is a characteristic clinical feature of encephalitic rabies. Pathologic changes include the presence of eosinophilic inclusions called Negri bodies in the cytoplasm of neurons and inflammatory changes. Imaging studies may be normal and do not show specific abnormalities. An antemortem laboratory diagnosis can be made with the detection of rabies virus antigen or RNA in tissues (e.g., skin) and/or body fluids (e.g., saliva) and with serologic testing. There is no known effective therapy for rabies, although there have been rare survivors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Encephalitic rabies; Encephalitis; Encephalomyelitis; Hydrophobia; Lyssavirus; Paralytic rabies; Rabies; Rabies virus","animal; article; bites and stings; dog; encephalitic rabies; encephalitis; encephalomyelitis; health; history; human; hydrophobia; neglected disease; paralytic rabies; pathogenicity; rabies; Rabies virus; virology; encephalitic rabies; encephalitis; encephalomyelitis; hydrophobia; lyssavirus; paralytic rabies; rabies; rabies virus; Animals; Bites and Stings; Dogs; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Neglected Diseases; Rabies; Rabies virus; World Health",,,00729752,,,25015507,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903987808

In Egypt (3500 BC), it was believed that a set of channels are interconnected to the heart, transporting air, urine, air, blood, and the soul. One thousand years later, the heart was established as the center of the CVS by the Hippocratic Corpus in the medical school of Kos, and some of the CVS anatomical characteristics were defined. The CVS was known to transport blood via the right ventricle through veins and the pneuma via the left ventricle through arteries. Two hundred years later, in Alexandria, following the development of human anatomical dissection, Herophilus discovered that arteries were 6 times thicker than veins, and Erasistratus described the semilunar valves, emphasizing that arteries were filled with blood when ventricles were empty. Further, 200 years later, Galen demonstrated that arteries contained blood and not air. With the decline of the Roman Empire, Greco‑Roman medical knowledge about the CVS was preserved in Persia, and later in Islam where, Ibn Nafis inaccurately described pulmonary circulation. The resurgence of dissection of the human body in Europe in the 14th century was associated with the revival of the knowledge pertaining to the CVS. The main findings were the description of pulmonary circulation by Servetus, the anatomical discoveries of Vesalius, the demonstration of pulmonary circulation by Colombo, and the discovery of valves in veins by Fabricius. Following these developments, Harvey described blood circulation. © 2015, Specjalisci Dermatolodzy.

Methods: Numerous references concerning this entity can be found in the writings of the Hippocratic doctors (5th cent. B.C.), Archigenes of Apamea (1st cent. A.D.), Galen (2nd cent. A.D.), Aretaeus of Cappadocia (2nd cent. A.D), Oribasius (4th cent. A.D.), Theophilus Protospatharius (7th cent. A.D.), and Paulus Nicaeensis (7th-10th cent. A.D.). Results: In most cases the clinical manifestations, the prognosis and the method of treatment are presented. In all ancient writings we studied, the rupture of a liver abscess is also part of the main theme. In specific, the path that the fluid would follow after a rupture was considered to be a main prognostic factor, i.e. if the fluid ""coursed into the stomach"", the patient would definitely die.

However, few references to it can be found in ancient manuscripts. A relevant discussion on presbyopia appears in a book called Symposiacs written by Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus around 100 A.C. In this work, Plutarch provided four explanations of presbyopia, associated with different theories of vision. One of the explanations is particularly interesting as it is based on a binocular theory of vision. In this theory, vision is produced when visual rays, emanating from the eyes, form visual cones that impinge on the objects to be seen. Visual rays coming from old people's eyes, it was supposed, are weaker than those from younger people's eyes; so the theory, to be logically coherent, implies that this effect is compensated by the increase in light intensity due to the overlapping, at a certain distance, of the visual cones coming from both eyes. Thus, it benefits the reader to move the reading text further away from the eyes in order to increase the fusion area of both visual cones. The historical hypothesis taking into consideration that the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea was the source of Plutarch's explanation of the theory is discussed. © 2013 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Their products differed remarkably and deviated from human and cow's milk, and physicians discussed the importance of minute variations in protein, fat and carbohydrates. Proprietary formulas were free of bacteria, and the companies prospered with mass production, international marketing and aggressive advertising. From 1932 on, medical societies restricted advertising to the laity. In 1939 Williams in Singapore and in 1970 Jelliffe in Jamaica suspected that commercial formula may be increasing infant mortality in the Third World. Breastfeeding continued to decline during the early 20th century, falling in 1970 below 10% in the USA. The Swiss 'Third World Group' and the US 'Infant Formula Action Coalition' linked infant mortality and industry marketing in the Third World. The controversy of 1970-1984 led to the WHO Code, which regulated the advertising and marketing of baby food.

By the early 1900s, PHN leaders recognized that graduates needed broader education than provided by hospital training schools to prepare nurses to address social conditions and promote health and hygiene for populations. Current themes in professional nursing, such as social determinants of health, have their roots in early discourse about PHN education.

This paper explores the case notes of all 462 servicemen who were admitted with functional neurological disorders between 1914 and 1919. Many of these were severe or chronic cases referred to the National Hospital because of its acknowledged expertise and the resources it could call upon. Biographical data was collected together with accounts of the patient's military experience, his symptoms, diagnostic interpretations and treatment outcomes. Analysis of the notes showed that motor syndromes (loss of function or hyperkinesias), often combined with somato-sensory loss, were common presentations. Anxiety and depression as well as vegetative symptoms such as sweating, dizziness and palpitations were also prevalent among this patient population. Conversely, psychogenic seizures were reported much less frequently than in comparable accounts from German tertiary referral centres. As the war unfolded the number of physicians who believed that shell shock was primarily an organic disorder fell as research failed to find a pathological basis for its symptoms. However, little agreement existed among the Queen Square doctors about the fundamental nature of the disorder and it was increasingly categorised as functional disorder or hysteria.

Background: Typhus is associated with poverty and overcrowding. During wars in the pre-antibiotic era, civilians were particularly susceptible to epidemics, which military governments feared would spread to their troops. Design: This discussion paper draws on archival data from three typhus epidemics in the Second World War to examine the expert work of British nurses in caring for victims during these potential public health disasters. Data Sources: The published sources for the paper include material from nursing and medical journals published between 1940-1947. Archival sources come from the National Archives in Kew, the Wellcome Library and the Army Medical Services Museum, between 1943-1945. Of particular interest is the correspondence with Dame Katharine Jones from nurses on active service overseas. Implications for Nursing: Whilst epidemics of typhus are now rare, nurses in the present day may be required to care for the public in environments of extreme poverty and overcrowding, where life-threatening infectious diseases are prevalent. This article has demonstrated that it is possible for expert and compassionate nursing to alleviate suffering and prevent death, even when medical technologies are unavailable. Conclusion: Expert and compassionate care, adequate nutrition and hydration and attention to hygiene needs are crucial when there are limited pharmacological treatments and medical technologies available to treat infectious diseases. The appreciation of this could have implications for nurses working in current global conflicts. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Compassionate care; History of nursing work; Nursing in the Second World War; Typhus; Wartime nursing practices","history; history; human; nursing; Typhus, Epidemic Louse-Borne; United Kingdom; war; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Typhus, Epidemic Louse-Borne; World War II",,,03092402,,JANUD,24256312,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901944273

These varied clinical presentations took the form of abnormal movements, deaf-mutism, mental confusion, and delusional disorders. In Anglo-Saxon countries, the term 'shell shock' was used to define these disorders. The debate on whether the war was responsible for these disorders divided mobilized neuropsychiatrists. In psychological theories, war is seen as the principal causal factor. In hystero-pithiatism, developed by Joseph Babinski (1857-1932), trauma was not directly caused by the war. It was rather due to the unwillingness of the soldier to take part in the war. Permanent suspicion of malingering resulted in the establishment of a wide range of medical experiments. Many doctors used aggressive treatment methods to force the soldiers exhibiting war neuroses to return to the front as quickly as possible. Medicomilitary collusion ensued. Electrotherapy became the basis of repressive psychotherapy, such as 'torpillage', which was developed by Clovis Vincent (1879-1947), or psychofaradism, which was established by Gustave Roussy (1874-1948). Some soldiers refused such treatments, considering them a form of torture, and were brought before courts-martial. Famous cases, such as that of Baptiste Deschamps (1881-1953), raised the question of the rights of the wounded. Soldiers suffering from psychotrauma, ignored and regarded as malingerers or deserters, were sentenced to death by the courts-martial. Trials of soldiers or doctors were also held in Germany and Austria. After the war, psychoneurotics long haunted asylums and rehabilitation centers. Abuses related to the treatment of the Great War psychoneuroses nevertheless significantly changed medical concepts, leading to the modern definition of 'posttraumatic stress disorder'. © 2014 S.

This review documents the history of vaccines and vaccination in India with an objective to derive lessons for policy direction to expand the benefits of vaccination in the country. A brief historical perspective on smallpox disease and preventive efforts since antiquity is followed by an overview of 19th century efforts to replace variolation by vaccination, setting up of a few vaccine institutes, cholera vaccine trial and the discovery of plague vaccine. The early twentieth century witnessed the challenges in expansion of smallpox vaccination, typhoid vaccine trial in Indian army personnel, and setting up of vaccine institutes in almost each of the then Indian States. In the post-independence period, the BCG vaccine laboratory and other national institutes were established; a number of private vaccine manufacturers came up, besides the continuation of smallpox eradication effort till the country became smallpox free in 1977. The Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) (1978) and then Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) (1985) were launched in India. The intervening events since UIP till India being declared non-endemic for poliomyelitis in 2012 have been described. Though the preventive efforts from diseases were practiced in India, the reluctance, opposition and a slow acceptance of vaccination have been the characteristic of vaccination history in the country. The operational challenges keep the coverage inequitable in the country. The lessons from the past events have been analysed and interpreted to guide immunization efforts.","Eradication; India; Smallpox; Vaccination; Vaccines","BCG vaccine; cholera vaccine; plague vaccine; smallpox vaccine; typhoid vaccine; vaccine; disease eradication; drug induced disease; drug manufacture; government; health care availability; health care delivery; health care management; health care need; health care personnel; health care utilization; health program; human; India; mass immunization; poliomyelitis; public health service; review; vaccination; vaccine production; world health organization; history; poliomyelitis; preventive health service; procedures; smallpox; statistics and numerical data; tuberculosis; vaccination; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Immunization Programs; India; Poliomyelitis; Smallpox; Tuberculosis; Vaccination; Vaccines",,,09715916,,IMIRE,24927336,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902169031

The main objectives of this paper are hence to contribute to the understanding and analysis of a major case example from World War II. Materials: The article's research is based on work at the Bundesarchiv in Koblenz, the Max Planck Gesellschaft in Berlin, and literature regarding the Fuehrungsstab der Luftwaffe, undertaken as part of a larger scale project on the history of the neurosciences and psychiatry in the first half of the 20th century. Summary: The current article focuses particularly on the Ostfeldzug of the Wehrmacht and the creation of emergency care chains in military neurology and neurological surgery. Its results show how major German neurologists, such as Otfrid Foerster, Wilhelm Toennis, Georg Merrem and Klaus Joachim Zuelch have contributed to the development of emergency care chains in military neurology. Key Messages: In conclusion, despite the atrocities and often-inhumane ways through which knowledge was gathered in contemporary military neurology, a better understanding of modern neurology can be gained from a critical assessment of the history of military neurology during World War II. © 2014 S.

There is now very good science to support physical training and the delivery of rehabilitation, which now begins at the earliest time possible in the intensive care unit. From there, a robust structure of rehabilitation supports the patient back to duty or to the point of discharge. What has not altered is the seemingly never-ending debate about the provision of continued support (or lack of) after soldiers are finally discharged. Despite this fact, it is highly likely that Lt.

For this paper, letters exchanged during World War I were studied. Professional as well as personal issues were discussed. An international neurology meeting in Berne in September 1914 had to be cancelled due to the war. They hoped that (neuro)scientists would remain politically neutral, continue scientific cooperation, and even be able to influence the course of the war. Winkler and Monakow tried to continue their work on the International Brain Atlas. Although living in neutral countries (The Netherlands and Switzerland), they observed that their practice and scientific work suffered from war conditions. While Winkler continued his activities as a neurologist, Monakow, affected emotionally, experienced a change in scientific interest toward psychoneurology. He used his diaschisis concept, originally an explanation for transient phenomena in stroke, as a metaphor for the social and cultural effects of the war. He directly related cultural development and brain science, bringing in his own emotions, which resulted in the first of several publications on the relations between biology, brain science, and culture. © 2014 S.

The tobacco industry's documented history of subverting control efforts required innovative approaches by WHO - led by Gro Harlem Brundtland - including invocation of its constitutional authority to develop treaties. In 2003, WHO member states adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). In the decade since, 177 countries have ratified and started to implement its full provisions.

Medical practice may appear distant and static and perhaps seems to have been somewhat ineffectual in the face of so much trauma and in the light of the enormous advances in medicine and surgery over the last century. However, this is an illusion of time and of course medical, surgical and psychiatric knowledge and procedures were developing rapidly at the time and the war years accelerated implementation of many important advances. Transfusion practice lay at the heart of resuscitation, and although direct transfusion from donor to recipient was still used, Geoffrey Keynes from Britain, Oswald Robertson from America and his namesake Lawrence Bruce Robertson from Canada, developed methods for indirect transfusion from donor to recipient by storing blood in bottles and also blood-banking that laid the foundation of modern transfusion medicine. This review explores the historical setting behind the development of blood transfusion up to the start of the First World War and on how they progressed during the war and afterwards. A fresh look may renew interest in how a novel medical speciality responded to the needs of war and of post-war society. © 2015 British Blood Transfusion Society.","First World War; Medicine; Transfusion","citric acid; anticoagulation; bleeding; blood bank; blood compatibility; blood donor; blood group; blood transfusion; blood volume; hemostasis; human; hypotension; injury; medical practice; medical society; phlebotomy; resuscitation; Review; syringe; transfusion medicine; treatment indication; war; blood transfusion; history; war; Blood Transfusion; History, 20th Century; Humans; World War I",,,09587578,,TRMDE,25586955,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921454991

In France, a legal government, under the direction of Marshal Pétain, took a series of xenophobic measures of which the Jews were the first victims.

In 1914, the scientific community had access to new knowledge on transmission of malaria parasites and their control, but the military were unprepared, and underestimated the nature, magnitude and dispersion of this enemy. In summarizing available information for allied and axis military forces, this review contextualizes the challenge posed by malaria, because although data exist across historical, medical and military documents, descriptions are fragmented, often addressing context specific issues. Military malaria surveillance statistics have, therefore, been summarized for all theatres of the War, where available. These indicated that at least 1.5 million solders were infected, with case fatality ranging from 0.2 -5.0%. As more countries became engaged in the War, the problem grew in size, leading to major epidemics in Macedonia, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Italy. Trans-continental passages of parasites and human reservoirs of infection created ideal circumstances for parasite evolution. Details of these epidemics are reviewed, including major epidemics in England and Italy, which developed following home troop evacuations, and disruption of malaria control activities in Italy. Elsewhere, in sub-Saharan Africa many casualties resulted from high malaria exposure combined with minimal control efforts for soldiers considered semi-immune. Prevention activities eventually started but were initially poorly organized and dependent on local enthusiasm and initiative. Nets had to be designed for field use and were fundamental for personal protection. Multiple prevention approaches adopted in different settings and their relative utility are described. Clinical treatment primarily depended on quinine, although efficacy was poor as relapsing Plasmodium vivax and recrudescent Plasmodium falciparum infections were not distinguished and managed appropriately. Reasons for this are discussed and the clinical trial data summarized, as are controversies that arose from attempts at quinine prophylaxis (quininization). In essence, the First World War was a vast experiment in political, demographic, and medical practice which exposed large gaps in knowledge of tropical medicine and unfortunately, of malaria. Research efforts eventually commenced late in the War to address important clinical questions which established a platform for more effective strategies, but in 1918 this relentless foe had outwitted and weakened both allied and axis powers. © 2014 Brabin.","Malaria; Quinine; World war one","quinine; antimalarial agent; army; clinical assessment; clinical trial (topic); control strategy; disease surveillance; environmental exposure; epidemic; epidemiological data; fatality; human; infection prevention; Macedonian (people); malaria; malaria control; malaria falciparum; medical practice; Mesopotamia; molecular evolution; Plasmodium vivax; Review; soldier; tropical medicine; war; Africa; bed net; Europe; history; malaria; mortality; mosquito control; procedures; soldier; Southern Europe; utilization; war; Africa; Antimalarials; Europe; History, 20th Century; Humans; Malaria; Mediterranean Region; Military Personnel; Mortality; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Nets; Quinine; Tropical Medicine; World War I",,,14752875,,,25515618,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924334863

With over 26 000 deaths among American soldiers, the offensive is considered ""America's deadliest battle"". The Meuse-Argonne offensive coincided with the highly fatal second wave of the influenza pandemic in 1918. In Europe and in U.S. Army training camps, 1918 pandemic influenza killed around 45 000 American soldiers making it questionable which battle should be regarded ""America's deadliest"". The origin of the influenza pandemic has been inextricably linked with the men who occupied the military camps and trenches during the First World War. The disease had a profound impact, both for the military apparatus and for the individual soldier. It struck all the armies and might have claimed toward 100 000 fatalities among soldiers overall during the conflict while rendering millions ineffective. Yet, it remains unclear whether 1918 pandemic influenza had an impact on the course of the First World War. Still, even until this day, virological and bacteriological analysis of preserved archived remains of soldiers that succumbed to 1918 pandemic influenza has important implications for preparedness for future pandemics.

We will study Pliny's use of Greek sources and ask how he took up his predecessors' works while integrating the changes that took place during the centuries in the diagnosis and treatment of pain. This cultural graft remains elusive because we do not have access to all of Pliny's Greek sources. When Pliny speaks about these plants, he sometimes copies out information, adding or removing details, and occasionally makes significant mistakes. The graft was particularly difficult in this case because these analgesic plants were considered so special and poisonous that they were sometimes rejected or even condemned. Nevertheless, we can say that this cultural graft succeeded, despite some obstacles, because Pliny assimilated and adapted these old Greek materials to his own time, society, and project.",,"analgesic agent; narcotic agent; article; chemistry; cultural anthropology; history; medicinal plant; pain; publication; Analgesics; Greek World; History, Ancient; Manuscripts, Medical; Narcotics; Pain; Plants, Medicinal; Roman World",,,09251421,,,25195330,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907245133

In impoverished Greece of the Interwar period, factors such as criminal ignorance, or lack of information on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) along with inadequate health controls of sex workers, resulted in a dramatic spread of syphilis, whereas ""Andreas Syggros"" hospital accommodated thousands of patients. The inflow of 1.300.000 Greek refugees from Asia Minor, after the Greek defeat by the Turkish army in the war of 1922, resulted in a notable change in the demographics of the country, while the combination of miserable living conditions, unemployment, economic crisis of the Interwar period, political instability and dysfunction of the State led to an increased number of illegal sex workers and syphilis outbreaks. Despite the introduction of an ad hoc Act to control STDs since 1923, the State was unable to limit the transmissibility of syphilis and to control prostitution. Unfortunately, the value of this historical paradigm is borne out by a contemporary example, i.e. the scandal of HIV seropositive sex workers in -beset by economic crisis- Greece in May 2012. It turns out that ignorance, failure to comply with the law, change in the mentality of the citizens in an economically ruined society, and most notably dysfunction of public services during periods of crisis, are all risk factors for the spread of serious infectious diseases.","Demography; Greece; Prostitution; Syphilis","arsenic; bismuth; mercury; potassium iodide; bismuth; mercury derivative; organoarsenic derivative; potassium iodide; Article; bacterial transmission; criminal behavior; demography; economic recession; epidemic; Greece; human; infection control; medical information; medical record review; prostitution; sexually transmitted disease; social aspect; syphilis; war; female; history; legislation and jurisprudence; poverty; prostitution; refugee; statistics and numerical data; syphilis; Arsenicals; Bismuth; Economic Recession; Female; Greece; History, 20th Century; Hospitals, Isolation; Humans; Mercury Compounds; Potassium Iodide; Poverty; Refugees; Sex Workers; Syphilis; World War I; World War II",,,03920488,,GIDVD,25068236,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84913570490

The ROK and the WHO handled the projects including health services, communicable disease prevention and control, control of noncommunicable diseases, and protection of health.

However, recent papers question their accuracy and conclude that coconut was introduced to the region by the Spaniards after their conquests.ScopeIn order to examine the value of such claims, an extensive search was conducted of the relevant historical accounts of coconut in America and in the Orient.Key ResultsThe Spanish chronicler Oviedo (1478-1557) is found to have effectively used fruit and seed size to distinguish coconut from other palms. In addition, it is shown that he has been inaccurately faulted with incorrectly representing a cluster of coconuts. The original drawing, a cluster of a native Bactris, was in the marginalia and was only assigned to coconut after Oviedo's death. Finally, the location is identified of a coastal Panamanian site described by Pedro Mártir de Anglería and where tidal dispersal of coconuts was observed.ConclusionsThis previously overlooked evidence confirms the pre-historical presence of coconut in Panama. Genetic data indicate that it must have been brought there directly or indirectly from the Philippines. But when, where and by whom remains a subject of research. Further molecular marker studies, computer simulation of natural drift and archaeological research could contribute to this research. © The Author 2013.","Central America; Coconut; Cocos nucifera; early trans-Pacific voyaging; New World flora; oceanic current dissemination; Panama; Spanish explorations","archaeology; coastal zone; fruit; genetic analysis; prehistoric; regional pattern; seed size; simulation; Pacific Coast [Panama]; Panama [Central America]; agriculture; Central America; coconut; early trans-Pacific voyaging; history; New World flora; oceanic current dissemination; Panama; Philippines; review; Spanish explorations; Central America; Coconut; Cocos nucifera; early trans-Pacific voyaging; New World flora; oceanic current dissemination; Panama; Spanish explorations; Agriculture; Cocos; History, 15th Century; History, Medieval; Panama; Philippines",,,03057364,,ANBOA,24227445,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891544368

Most previous studies evaluating the utility of IoMRI have focused on enhancing tumors. Objective: To report our experience with the use of high-field IoMRI (1.5 T) for both enhancing and nonenhancing gliomas. Methods: An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performed of 102 consecutive glioma patients (104 surgeries, 2010-2012). Pre-, intra-, and postoperative tumor volumes were assessed. Analysis was performed with the use of volumetric T2 images in 43 nonenhancing and 13 minimally enhancing tumors and with postcontrast volumetric magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo images in 48 enhancing tumors. Results: In 58 cases, preoperative imaging showed tumors likely to be amenable to complete resection. Intraoperative electrocorticography was performed in 32 surgeries, and 14 cases resulted in intended subtotal resection of tumors due to involvement of deep functional structures. No further resection (complete resection before IoMRI) was required in 25 surgeries, and IoMRI showed residual tumor in 79 patients. Of these, 25 surgeries did not proceed to further resection (9 due to electrocorticography findings, 14 due to tumor in deep functional areas, and 2 due to surgeon choice). Additional resection that was performed in 54 patients resulted in a final median residual tumor volume of 0.21 mL (0.6%). In 79 patients amenable to complete resection, the intraoperative median residual tumor volume for the T2 group was higher than for the magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo group (1.088 mL vs 0.437 mL; P =.049), whereas the postoperative median residual tumor volume was not statistically significantly different between groups. Conclusion: IoMRI enhances the extent of resection, particularly for nonenhancing gliomas.","Electrocorticography; Extent of resection; Glioblastoma; Low-grade glioma; Residual tumor volume","steroid; adult; anesthesia induction; article; basal ganglion; brain edema; cancer localization; cancer surgery; capsula interna; comparative study; contrast enhancement; controlled study; craniotomy; deep vein thrombosis; diffusion tensor imaging; drug treatment failure; electrocorticography; evoked somatosensory response; external beam radiotherapy; female; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; glioblastoma; glioma; headache; hospitalization; human; institutional review; interventional magnetic resonance imaging; intraoperative period; language disability; major clinical study; male; mental deterioration; middle aged; motor performance; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; operation duration; parietal lobe; patient history of chemotherapy; patient history of neurosurgery; patient history of radiotherapy; postoperative complication; postoperative infection; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; retrospective study; seizure; temporal lobe; time to treatment; treatment duration; tumor volume; volumetry; weakness; world health organization; aged; Brain Neoplasms; glioma; neuroimaging; neuronavigation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; patient monitoring; procedures; young adult; Adult; Aged; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Glioma; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Neuroimaging; Neuronavigation; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",,,0148396X,,NRSRD,24368543,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897449515

Why was a paper on this unexpected topic printed in the newly founded journal? To Nilsson, the demise of the Roman Empire was explained by the ""bastardization"" occurring between ""races"" from different parts of the realm. Offspring from mixed couples were of a less stable ""type"" than their parents, due to the breaking up by recombination of the original hereditary dispositions, which led to a general loss of competence to rule and govern. Thus, the ""hardness"" of human genes, together with their recombination, was - according to Nilsson - the main cause of the fall of Rome. Nilsson's argument is not particularly convincingly presented. Human ""races"" are taken to have the same genetic structure as inbred crop strains, and Nilsson believes in a metaphysical unity between the individual and the race to which it belongs. However, in my view, Martin P:son Nilsson and his friend Herman Nilsson-Ehle had wider aims with the article than to explain a historical event. The article can be read as indicating strong support from the classical human sciences to the ambitious new science of genetics. Support is also transferred from genetics to the conservative worldview, where the immutability and inflexibility of the Mendelian genes are used to strengthen the wish for greater stability in politics and life.

I hypothesize that the performers imitate/simulate with drums, shouting and 'bruitist' sound poems, the noises of war, staging themselves as war neurotics in a kind of shocking clinical demonstration. Both discourses intersect in the fact that many dadaists try to dodge the draft by simulating madness.

Thesere searches were partly performed at the University of Poznań, in the period 1926-1939, at the Faculty of Medicine of the Department of Physics where Tucholski was employed as a senior assistant and was the closest associate of professor S. Kalandyk, partly at the Department of Forensic Medicine headed by professor S. Horoszkiewicz in the chemical-toxicological laboratory which Tucholski ranin the years 1931-1939, partly at the Warsaw University of Technology in the Department of Explosives Technology of the Faculty of Chemistry headed by professor T. Urbański, where he had been lecturing ""On the latest theories of explosives"" since 1937 and in 1934-35 in Cambridge, as a teaching fellow of the National Culture Fund, in Colloid Science Laboratory headed by professor E.K. Rideal. In 1903 Tucholski moved with his parents to Zabaykalye, in 1911--to Brazil. He returned to Poland in 1920, joined the Polish Army and with the 14th Polish Medium Regiment fought on the fronts of the Polish-Bolshevik War. He was drafted to the School of Pyrotechnics Foremen at Corps District Command number VII (Poznań). After graduating, Tucholski remained on active duty as a professional pyrotechnic: from 1921 to 1929 he was appointed the head of the Laboratory of Chemical and Pyrotechnic Ammunition Workshop No. 2 in Poznań and as an inspector of magazines of explosives. In 1927 he was transferred to the reserves, in 1932 after having graduated from the Officer Cadet School in Jarocin, Tucholski was appointed a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve, and later moved from the officers infantry corpsto the army ordnance corps. As part of his specialty, he constantly cooperated with the army. In the years 1937-1939,Tucholski was a technical adviser to the Ministry of Military Affairs and from August 1939--an independent researcher at the Institute of Armament Technology. He took part in the works of the Explosives Commission of the Military Technical Society. Tadeusz Tucholski was a self-taught man. He passed his A-level examsin course of his military service in October 1923 and began studying chemistry at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Poznań. He obtained his Master's degree in 1927, the rank and the degree of Ph.D. in the field of chemical sciences and physics in 1930. In 1936, he became the Associate Professor of physical chemistry of explosives at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Technology in Warsaw. Tucholski invented the method of the differential thermal analysis. He is the author of the widely used differential calorimeter which records the-processes of conversion of explosives during heating, presently known as the Differential Scanning Calorimeter.",,"article; calorimetry; chemistry; history; human; male; personnel; Poland; university; war; Calorimetry; Chemistry; Faculty; Historiography; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Poland; Research Personnel; World War II",,,0023589X,,,25033530,"Polish",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906924551

Building an epidemiological canon within WHO's Mental Health Programme faced numerous obstacles. First, an idealist notion of mental health inherent in WHO's own definition of health contributed to tensions around the object of psychiatric epidemiology. Second, the transfer of methods from medical epidemiology to research on mental disorders required mobilizing conceptual justifications, including a 'contagion argument'. Third, epidemiological research at WHO was stymied by other public health needs, resource scarcity and cultural barriers. This history partly recapitulates the development of psychiatric epidemiology in North America and Europe, but is also shaped by concerns in the developing world, translated through firstworld 'experts'. Resolving the tensions arising from these obstacles allowed WHO to establish its international schizophrenia research, which in turn provided proof of concept for psychiatric epidemiology in the place of scepticism within and without psychiatry. © The Author 2014; all rights reserved.

This brief manuscript will relate the story of the BCS development. While much of the ground work for the BCS goes back to the pharmacokinetic and drug absorption research by Gordon Amidon (GLA) in the 1970s and 1980s, the realization of the need for a classification or categorization of drug and drug products for setting dissolution standards became apparent to GLA during his 1990-1991 sabbatical year at the FDA. Initiated at the invitation of the then CEDR director, Dr. Carl Peck, to become a visiting scientist at the FDA, the goal was to promote regulatory research at the FDA, in my case, in biopharmaceutics, and to develop a science-based system to simplify regulatory requirements. © 2014 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","absorption; biopharmaceutics; dissolution standards; intestinal permeability; solubility","drug; drug; bioequivalence; correlational study; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug classification; drug disposition; drug penetration; drug solubility; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; membrane permeability; narrow therapeutic index; nonhuman; note; pH; pharmacological parameters; theory; world health organization; animal; bioavailability; biological model; chemical model; chemistry; classification; drug administration route; drug approval; food and drug administration; history; metabolism; nomenclature; pharmaceutics; pharmacokinetics; solubility; United States; Animals; Biological Availability; Biopharmaceutics; Drug Administration Routes; Drug Approval; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Chemical; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacokinetics; Solubility; Terminology as Topic; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",,,15507416,,,24961917,"English",Note,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908357128

The objective of the project, known as Iran 10, was twofold: to set up a health service for mothers and children and to initiate a field training program for Iranian physicians, nurses, and other health care providers. Drawing on 180 letters Jackson wrote to her family in Canada from Iran, this article analyzes the MCH Centre as a contact zone and considers the relationships Jackson developed with staff affiliated with the project. The Centre became a space of cross-cultural encounters, where locally and foreign-trained Iranian staff and expatriates mingled and shared working relationships. I argue that authority was negotiated and contested through interactions and associations that were often unequal and framed by notions of progress, modernization, race, and health.

The disease frequently affects children who live in poor socioeconomic conditions. Between 1952 and 1964, WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) led a global eradication campaign using injectable benzathine penicillin. Recent developments using a single dose of oral azithromycin have renewed optimism that eradication can be achieved through a comprehensive large-scale treatment strategy. We review historical efforts to eradicate yaws and argue that this goal is now technically feasible using new tools and with the favorable environment for control of NTDs. We also summarize the work of WHO's Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases in leading the renewed eradication initiative and call on the international community to support efforts to achieve the 2020 eradication goal. The critical factor remains access to azithromycin. Excluding medicines, the financial cost of yaws eradication could be as little as US$ 100 million.The development of new tools has renewed interest in eradication of yaws; with modest support, the WHO eradication target of 2020 can be achieved. © 2014 Asiedu et al.",,"azithromycin; benzathine penicillin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; Article; clinical trial (topic); cost; cost effectiveness analysis; disease eradication; disease surveillance; disease transmission; dracunculiasis; feasibility study; health care policy; hookworm infection; human; malaria; mutation; point of care testing; poliomyelitis; polymerase chain reaction; single drug dose; smallpox; syphilis rapid test; world health organization; yaws; yellow fever; adolescent; adult; child; health; history; infant; Neglected Diseases; newborn; preschool child; yaws; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Eradication; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Neglected Diseases; Yaws; Young Adult",,,19352727,,,25254372,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907573444

Despite multiple names and many definitions and classifications over the past two centuries, the medical world is no closer to discovering the cause or causes of this enigmatic bladder disorder, currently known as interstitial cystitis, bladder pain syndrome or painful bladder syndrome and hypersensitive bladder. International consensus on nomenclature, definitions and diagnosis is now essential to ensure that studies are carried out on the same basis, thereby generating meaningful data that can be relied on for further use. In our electronic age, multiple names and definitions cause confusion for researchers, clinicians and patients, even leading to the patient's diagnosis being unrecognized by authorities, resulting in refusal to reimburse treatment or provide social benefits.

We searched The Lancet's archives in this Series paper to show the efforts of surgeons in World War 1 to understand and treat postamputation pain in its own right both during and immediately after the war. Despite unprecedented patient numbers and levels of civilian medical expertise, little progress was made in providing relief from this type of pain, a grave concern to the surgeons treating these soldiers.

The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH) was charged with the task of developing microbial hygiene standards, although it found itself embroiled in debate with the WHO over the nature these standards should take. The WHO was increasingly relying upon the input of biometricians and especially the International Commission on Microbial Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) which had developed statistical sampling plans for determining the microbial counts in the final end products. The CCFH, however, was initially more focused on a qualitative approach which looked at the entire food production system and developed codes of practice as well as more descriptive end-product specifications which the WHO argued were 'not scientifically correct'. Drawing upon historical archival material (correspondence and reports) from the WHO and FAO, this article examines this debate over microbial hygiene standards and suggests that there are many lessons from history which could shed light upon current debates and efforts in international food safety management systems and approaches. © Royal Society for Public Health 2014.","Betty C Hobbs; Codex Alimentarius; Codex Committee on Food Hygiene; Food and Agriculture Organization; food hygiene; food safety; Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point; International Commission on Microbial Specifications for Foods; standards; United Nations International Organization for Standardization; World Health Organization","agricultural worker; bacteriology; canned food; catering service; European Union; food and drug administration; food chain; food freezing; food industry; food poisoning; food processing; food safety; government; health care personnel; historical research; human; medical research; poultry farming; practice guideline; public health; review; risk assessment; risk management; salmonellosis; standardization; war; world health organization; food contamination; food control; Foodborne Diseases; history; organization and management; prevention and control; Food Contamination; Food Industry; Food Microbiology; Food Safety; Foodborne Diseases; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Public Health; World Health Organization",,,17579139,,,24990138,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903790304

Since Paleolithic man believed in an afterlife and even in Mesoamerica and the Andes cultures, care and ceremony were practiced to the burial of the dead in an ancestral cult. Mortuary rituals were developed in Pre-dynastic Egypt (4500-3100 BC) but apparently they had begun before in America, c. 5000 BC. Mummies served for assisting the soul to survive and for preventing the dead from frightening the livings. Incas arrived at a point of perfection in these practices after other Andean cultures but we should not forget their older predecessors, the Chinchorro culture on the arid coast of the Atacama Desert. Different steps in the technique can be distinguished in both worlds: natural desiccation covered by animal skins, methods to protect the body skin and flesh removal, replacement with clay; black, red or mud-coated corpses, evisceration, body cavity treatment, cleansing and anointing the interior, brain removal, mummified bodies, corpses covered with natron, before being washed and bandaged or wrapped. It will be necessary to carefully check dates, techniques and periods in the two zones to establish exactly the evolution of the methods applied. © 2016, Croatian Scientific Society for the History of Health.

The purposes were not just to save lives, but to benefit the military by returning more patients to duty and reducing the size of the hospital system through fewer infections and shorter hospital stays. The Army examined the utility of the units at the end of the war and retained them for any future conflicts, but opposition also survived. The question was the utility for the Army: was it worth making a substantial investment, and reducing care for other wounded soldiers, for the most grievously wounded, perhaps 1 percent of the total? Devising an effective way to organize forward SHs was a problem in the interwar years and early in World War II (WWII). But from the late 1930s, the Army never reexamined whether it should provide forward surgery, only how to do so, including pushing surgeons even further forward on the battlefield. At the end of WWII, the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) was created to perform the mission, although the MASH was only the latest format. © 2012 The Author.","combat surgery; hospitals; military; military medicine; mobile army; patient evacuation; surgical hospitals; trauma surgery; triage","general surgery; history; human; military medicine; public hospital; war; General Surgery; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Hospitals, Military; Humans; Military Medicine; War; World War I",,,00225045,,JHMAA,22653962,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890494636

These problems, which are often poorly understood and considered rather mysterious, are still relevant because they are difficult to treat medically. Functional neuroimaging techniques now enable us to better understand their pathophysiology and to consider new rehabilitation techniques. Phantom limbs have often been a source of inspiration to writers, particularly in the period following the First World War, which was responsible for thousands of amputees. Some artists have suffered from postamputation complications themselves and have expressed them through their artistic works. Blaise Cendrars (1887-1961), one of the greatest authors of the twentieth century, suffered from stump pain and phantom limb phenomena for almost half a century following the amputation of his right arm during the First World War. He suffered from these phenomena until the end of his life and his literary work and personal correspondence are peppered with references to them. Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891), one of the most famous poets in world literature, developed severe stump pain after his right leg was amputated due to a tumor. He survived for only six months after the procedure but left behind an account of the pain he experienced in correspondence to his family. The famous pianist Paul Wittgenstein (1887-1961), whose right arm was amputated during the First World War, became a famous left-handed concert pianist. The phantom movements of his right hand helped him to develop the dexterity of his left hand. The impact on the artistic life of these three men provides an original illustration of the various postamputation complications, specifically phantom limbs, stump pain, and moving phantom. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Arthur Rimbaud; Artistic realization; Blaise Cendrars; Paul Wittgenstein; Phantom limb; Stump pain","adaptation; adaptive behavior; agnosia; amputation stump; art; history; human; literature; male; music; nociception; pathophysiology; psychology; public figure; war; Adaptation, Physiological; Adaptation, Psychological; Amputation Stumps; Famous Persons; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Literature, Modern; Male; Music; Pain Perception; Phantom Limb; Poetry as Topic; World War I",,,0964704X,,JHNEF,24956238,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919847105

It also provides a further understanding of Cushing the man. While in France during World War I, Cushing was initially assigned to British hospital units. This service began in May 1917 and ended abruptly in May 1918 when the British cashiered him for repeated censorship violations. Returning to American command, he feared court martial. The army file on this matter (retrieved from the United States National Archives) indicates that US Army authorities recommended that Cushing be reprimanded and returned to the US for his violations. The army carried out neither recommendation, and no evidence exists that a court martial was considered. Cushing's army career and possible future academic life were protected by the actions of his surgical peers and Merritte Ireland, Chief Surgeon of the US Army in France. After this censorship episode, Cushing was made a neurosurgical consultant but was also sternly warned that further rule violations would not be tolerated by the US Army. Thereafter, despite the onset of a severe peripheral neuropathy, probably Guillian Barré's syndrome, Cushing was indefatigable in ministering to neurosurgical needs in the US sector in France. Cushing's repeated defying of censorship regulations reveals poor judgment plus an initial inability to be a ""team player."" The explanations he offered for his censorship violations showed an ability to bend the truth. Cushing's war journal is unclear as to exactly what transpired between him and the British and US armies. It also shows no recognition of the help he received from others who were instrumental in preventing his ignominious removal from service in France. Had that happened, his academic future and ability to train future neurosurgical leaders may have been seriously threatened. Cushing's foibles notwithstanding, all realized that he contributed greatly to both British and US war neurosurgery. United States Army surgeons who operated upon brain wounds in France recognized Cushing as their leader. © AANS, 2014.","Harvey cushing; History; World War I","army; France; government; Guillain Barre syndrome; history of medicine; human; literature; medical service; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; priority journal; review; United States; art; history; military medicine; neurosurgery; soldier; United Kingdom; war; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; Neurosurgery; United States; World War I",,,00223085,,JONSA,24949679,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905453870

By using the freak show analogy, the British press expressed their moral objection to this type of bodily display. But Body Worlds and nineteenth-century displays of human anomalies were linked in more complex and telling ways as both attempted to be simultaneously entertaining and educational. This essay argues that these forms of corporeal exhibitionism are both examples of the dynamic relationship between the popular and professional cultures of the body that we often erroneously think of as separate and discrete. By reading Body Worlds against the Victorian freak show, I seek to generate a fuller understanding of the historical and enduring relationship between exhibitionary culture and the discourses of science, and thus to argue that the scientific and the spectacular have been, and clearly continue to be, symbiotic modes of generating bodily knowledge. © 2012 The Author.","Body Worlds; freak shows; Gunther von Hagens; spectacle","anatomy; audiovisual equipment; cadaver; cultural anthropology; histology; history; human; posthumous care; publication; Anatomy, Artistic; Cadaver; Culture; Embalming; Exhibits as Topic; History, 19th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Plastic Embedding",,,00225045,,JHMAA,22661573,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890465770

In the last 10 years, the method has been extended to the pathological investigation. Stable isotope analysis to better understand a diet-related disease: celiac disease in ancient human bones was carried out. To do this, we analyzed the nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of human (n = 37) and faunal (n = 8) bone remains from the archaeological site of Cosa at Ansedonia, on the Tyrrhenian coast near Orbetello (Tuscany), including the skeletal remains of a young woman (late 1st century-early 2nd century Common Era [CE]) with morphological and genetic features suggestive of celiac disease. We compared the young woman's isotopic data with those of other individuals recovered at the same site but from two later time periods (6th century CE; 11-12th century CE) and with literature data from other Italian archaeological sites dating to the same period.

The author provides a useful historical survey of the field's recent rise to prominence and intelligently analyzes its respective strengths and weaknesses. His overall assessment of the field is quite skeptical, however. Evans cites many reasons for his skepticism, but his overall critique can be summarized in three words: plausibility, politicization, and popularity. Evans faults works of counterfactual history for their frequently implausible narratives, their promotion of political agendas, and their distressing degree of popularity. In advancing his critique, Evans makes many valid observations that call attention to important deficiencies in the field. But his view is a partial one that neglects countervailing evidence and never penetrates to the heart of why the field has left the margins for the mainstream. Evans's study provides a useful introduction to an understudied topic, but further research-ideally of a less partisan nature-is required for us to better understand counterfactual history's increasing appeal. © 2014 Wesleyan University.","Alternate history; Counterfactual history; Determinism; Historical consciousness; Memory; Nazi Germany; Normalization; World War II",,,,00182656,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908022347

Here, the author begins a broader examination of the potential role of culture by examining the myths and symbols that form the basis for medical culture and the medical self-image. The author argues that a medical self-image based on a de-contextualized medical mythology, the Asclepius myth, results in a sense of professional identity that is unbalanced, dehumanized, and characterized by unattainable expectations. The outward expression of this medical self-image, the medical culture, is often a-relational, unhealthy, stressed, or even toxic. The author suggests some ways of re-modeling medical culture, including its rituals and symbols, and medical education in ways that incorporate what is currently kept in its shadow. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Medical culture; Medical education; Medical mythology; Medical self-image; Medical symbols","clothing; health care delivery; history; human; literature; malpractice; medical education; medical student; physician attitude; psychology; self concept; Western world; Clothing; Education, Medical; Emblems and Insignia; Health Services Accessibility; History, Ancient; Humans; Mythology; Physician Impairment; Physician's Role; Self Concept; Students, Medical; Western World",,,10413545,,,25294627,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911992863

Since ancient times, a diverse array of materials from coconut shells to gold plates has been used for the repair of cranial defects. More recently, World War II greatly increased the demand for cranioplasty procedures and renewed interest in the search for a suitable synthetic material for cranioprostheses. Experimental evidence revealed that tantalum was biologically inert to acid and oxidative stresses. In fact, the observation that tantalum did not absorb acid resulted in the metal being named after Tantalus, the Greek mythological figure who was condemned to a pool of water in the Underworld that would recede when he tried to take a drink. In clinical use, malleability facilitated a single-stage cosmetic repair of cranial defects. Tantalum became the preferred cranioplasty material for more than 1000 procedures performed during World War II. In fact, its use was rapidly adopted in the civilian population. During World War II and the heyday of tantalum cranioplasty, there was a rapid evolution in prosthesis implantation and fixation techniques significantly shaping how cranioplasties are performed today. Several years after the war, acrylic emerged as the cranioplasty material of choice. It had several clear advantages over its metallic counterparts. Titanium, which was less radiopaque and had a more optimal thermal conductivity profile (less thermally conductive), eventually supplanted tantalum as the most common metallic cranioplasty material. While tantalum cranioplasty was popular for only a decade, it represented a significant breakthrough in synthetic cranioplasty. The experiences of wartime neurosurgeons with tantalum cranioplasty played a pivotal role in the evolution of modern cranioplasty techniques and ultimately led to a heightened understanding of the necessary attributes of an ideal synthetic cranioplasty material. Indeed, the history of tantalum cranioplasty serves as a model for innovative thinking and adaptive technology development.AANS, 2014.","Cranial defect; Cranioplasty; History; Neurosurgery; Tantalum; World war II","titanium; bone plate; Craniocerebral Trauma; craniotomy; history; history; human; procedures; prosthesis implantation; skull base; surgery; war; Bone Plates; Craniocerebral Trauma; Craniotomy; History, 20th Century; Humans; Prosthesis Implantation; Skull Base; Titanium; World War II",,,10920684,,,24684335,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897551675

She was also called a prostitute, and fictional accounts of her affairs with men further “tarnished” her reputation. Dual representations of Sappho existed within two centuries of her death. On the one hand, she was a role model for other poets to follow in their quest for fame, on the other she was the quintessential representation of female vice, which, at least by the Roman period, brought her infamy. Late antique and medieval Christian authors inherited this latter view, and vilified Sappho's sexuality, while church authorities, at least according to legend, had her works publicly burned. In the initial stages of the Renaissance, then, the humanist desire to reconnect with the pagan past had to proceed in the context of late medieval Christianity. Sappho's homoeroticism was erased, ultimately, in order that her skill could be lauded to fight misogyny. Hence, the humanists “rehabilitated” Sappho's virtue in a Christian context where same-sex love was considered an “unmentionable” vice. In order to argue that women were smart and capable, the humanists needed Sappho. She was perhaps the most famous, and most skilled, woman who had ever lived, and her example was used in an attempt to improve the lot of women in the early Renaissance. © 2014, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","ancient Greek sexuality; female homoeroticism; humanism; humanists; medieval misogyny; misogyny in the Middle Ages; proto-feminism; Sappho; Sappho reception; women's sexuality","cultural anthropology; erotica; female; history; human; lesbianism; literature; love; Erotica; Female; Greek World; History, Ancient; Homosexuality, Female; Humans; Love; Poetry as Topic",,,10894160,,,25298101,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908401103

It discusses an example of a controversy where an international health organisation (IHO) lost moral authority as a result of being accused of white supremacy and a pro-American engagement in Cold War politics. At the time of its readmission to the WMA, the MASA was controversial because of its failure to strike off its membership roll one of the doctors implicated the death in detention of Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko in 1977. It details how these activists viewed the American Medical Association as having campaigned for the MASA's readmission. The WMA's readmission of the MASA cost the former its relationships with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the British Medical Association-a dispute which continued until South Africa's democratic transition of 1994. With its focus on transnational activism in relation to the WMA and the effects of activists' allegations of racism on its internal politics, this article contributes to the literature on the history of IHOs.

Although he was only slightly injured, he died 6 hours later. The bullets were hollow and contained a crystalline white powder. They were 4-g bullets, semijacketed in cupronickel, containing 28 mg of aconitine. They were later known as akonitinnitratgeschosse. The Sipo (the Nazi security police) then ordered a trial with a 9-mm Parabellum cartridge containing Ditran, an anticholinergic drug with hallucinogenic properties causing intense mental confusion. In later years, QNB was used and given the NATO code BZ (3-quinuclidinyl-benzylate). It was proven that Saddam Hussein had this weapon (agent 15) manufactured and used it against the Kurds. Serbian forces used the same type of weapon in the Bosnian conflict, particularly in Srebrenica. The authors go on to list the Cold War toxic weapons developed by the KGB and the Warsaw pact countries for the discreet elimination of dissidents and proindependence leaders who had taken refuge in the West. These weapons include PSZh-13 launchers, the Troika electronic sequential pistol, and the ingenious 4-S110T captive piston system designed by the engineer Stechkin. Disguised as a cigarette case, it could fire a silent charge of potassium cyanide. This rogues gallery also includes the umbrella rigged to inject a pellet of ricin (or another phytalbumin of similar toxicity, such as abrin or crotin) that was used to assassinate the Bulgarian writer and journalist Georgi Markov on September 7, 1978, in London. During the autopsy, the discovery of a bullet burst into 4 or 5 parts has to make at once suspecting the use of a toxic substance. Toxicological analysis has to look for first and foremost aconitine, cyanide, suxamethonium, Ditran, BZ, or one of the toxic phytalbumins. The use of such complex weapons has to make suspect a powerful organization: army, secret service, terrorism. The existence of the Russian UDAR spray gun in the present day, however, shows that these weapons are still present. The possibility that one might be used to spray a charge of cyanide is still very real, especially as it would not be very difficult for an informed amateur to produce homemade toxic ammunition by adapting existing civil or military cartridges.

The frequency of each condition was calculated at the per individual and per tooth/socket level, and the results were compared between the sexes using Fisher's exact tests. Results Caries and antemortem tooth loss were slightly more common among women, but differences between the sexes were generally not significant. Males experienced higher rates of calculus and periodontal disease. There were no sex differences in the frequency of periapical lesions. Conclusions Comparable rates of caries, periapical lesions and antemortem tooth loss in females and males indicate broad similarity in the diets of men and women. The greater levels of calculus and periodontal disease in males might point to some dietary differences, but could also be explained by non-dietary factors. Overall, the findings suggest that significant gender differences in diet, described in some contemporaneous textual sources, were not widely observed in Roman Britain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Dento-alveolar pathology; Diet; Gender; Roman Britain; Sex","adolescent; adult; Caucasian; comparative study; cultural anthropology; ethnology; female; health; history; human; male; middle aged; pathology; sex difference; tooth; United Kingdom; Adolescent; Adult; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Great Britain; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Health; Roman World; Sex Factors; Tooth",,,00039969,,AOBIA,25150533,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906536728

In a lecture at the Tavistock Clinic, London, in October 1936, he made his strongest and most negative statements to that date about Nazi Germany. While in Berlin in September 1937 for lectures to the Jung Gesellschaft, his observations of Hitler at a military parade led him to conclude that should the catastrophe of war come it would be far more and bloodier than he had previously supposed. After the Sudetenland Crisis in Fall 1938, Jung in interviews made stronger comments on Hitler and Nazi Germany. The article shows how strongly anti-Nazi Jung's views were in relation to events during World War II such as Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland, the fall of France, the bombings of Britain, the U.S. entry into the War, and Allied troops advancing into Germany. Schoenl and Peck, 'An Answer to the Question: Was Jung, for a Time, a ""Nazi Sympathizer"" or Not?' (2012) demonstrated how his views of Nazi Germany changed from 1933 to March 1936.

Through the history of polio vaccination in Hungary, this article shows how Cold War politics shaped vaccine evaluation and implementation in the 1950s. On the one hand, the threat of polio created a safe place for hitherto unprecedented, open cooperation among governments and scientific communities on the two sides of the Iron Curtain. On the other hand, Cold War rhetoric influenced scientific evaluation of vaccines, choices of disease prevention, and ultimately the eradication of polio.","Children; Cold war; Eradication; Hungary; Polio; Sabin; Salk; Vaccines; World health organization","article; drug effect; health care delivery; history; human; Hungary; international cooperation; poliomyelitis; Poliomyelitis virus; politics; utilization review; vaccination; Delivery of Health Care; History, 20th Century; Humans; Hungary; International Cooperation; Poliomyelitis; Poliovirus; Politics; Vaccination",,,00075140,,BHMEA,24976164,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903169450

Before World War II, dermatology in German-speaking lands was at the forefront of medicine, and about 25% of the dermatologists were Jewish. Many perished during the Holocaust; others emigrated from Germany and played a major role in advancing dermatology in their new homes, especially in the United States. Erich Langer (1891-1957) was almost unique, because he survived the entire period in Berlin. Langer had been chief of dermatology at Berlin-Britz, a large city hospital, before 1933 but was discharged almost immediately after the Nazi takeover because of his Jewish roots. In June 1945 he returned to his old department and resumed charge. He became one of the key figures in rebuilding German dermatology in the immediate postwar years. He served as first chair of dermatology at the new Free University in Berlin, started two journals, and wrote several books. Until recently, very little was known about Erich Langer's mysterious tale of survival and how he evaded Nazi roundups. Fortunately, we have discovered considerable archival material that has allowed us to piece together, for the first time, a detailed account of Langer's courageous and remarkable story as the last Jewish dermatologist in Nazi Berlin. © 2014.",,"achievement; article; clinical practice; clinical research; dermatologist; dermatology; Germany; health care delivery; human; Jew; life event; medical education; personal experience; priority journal; private practice; public health; publication; racism; sexually transmitted disease; tinea capitis; art; history; holocaust; male; physician; war; Dermatology; Germany; History, 20th Century; Holocaust; Humans; Jews; Male; Physicians; World War II",,,0738081X,,CLDEE,25144942,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903943498

Methods: A qualitative analysis of written content was performed, focusing on regularities evident in content, and addressing the construction of the role of women in relation to food provision, as well as assertions for nutritional health. The setting comprised a desk-based study. The study sample encompassed 37 magazines, and yielded a corpus of 569 articles concerned with food or dietary supplements, of which 80.1% were advertisements. Results: Ministry of Food dietary advice featured prominently up to 1945 and advocated food consumption according to a simple nutrient classification. Advertising and article content also used this classification; advocating consumption of food and supplements on the grounds of energy, growth and protection of health was customary. Providing food to meet nutritional needs was depicted as fundamental to women's war effort and their role as dutiful housewives. Advertising in 1950s magazines also focused on nutritional claims, with a particular emphasis on energy provision. Conclusions: These claims reflected the prevailing food policy and scientific understanding of nutritional health.

However, the psychiatric legacy of the war is ambiguous. During World War 1, a new disorder (shellshock) and a new treatment (forward psychiatry) were introduced, but the former should not be thought of as the first recognition of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder and the latter did not offer the solution to the management of psychiatric casualties, as was subsequently claimed. For this Series paper, we researched contemporary publications, classified military reports, and casualty returns to reassess the conventional narrative about the effect of shellshock on psychiatric practice. We conclude that the expression of distress by soldiers was culturally mediated and that patients with postcombat syndromes presented with symptom clusters and causal interpretations that engaged the attention of doctors but also resonated with popular health concerns. Likewise, claims for the efficacy of forward psychiatry were inflated. The vigorous debates that arose in response to controversy about the nature of psychiatric disorders and the discussions about how these disorders should be managed remain relevant to the trauma experienced by military personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The psychiatric history of World War 1 should be thought of as an opportunity for commemoration and in terms of its contemporary relevance - not as an opportunity for self-congratulation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"explosive; army; Article; concussion; distress syndrome; electric shock; human; malingering; military medicine; neuropathology; neuropsychiatry; physician; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; psychiatrist; psychoanalysis; psychotrauma; publication; soldier; traumatic brain injury; unconsciousness; war; Brain Injuries; Combat Disorders; Europe; history; military medicine; psychology; United Kingdom; Brain Injuries; Combat Disorders; Europe; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Personnel; Military Psychiatry; World War I",,,01406736,,LANCA,25441201,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920847423

Typhoid vaccination led to the successful evasion of the disastrous epidemics of previous wars. The incidence of tetanus was probably decreased by giving millions of doses of horse antitoxin to wounded soldiers. Quinine treated but could not control malaria; its use required mass compulsion. Tuberculosis was not a great military problem during World War 1, although mortality in civilian populations increased substantially. Treatment of sexually transmitted infections remained a matter of aversive conditioning, with invasive antiseptics used in the absence of antibiotics.

During this time, in which the press had a critical role in expressing and shaping public opinion in Syria, it became clear to the emissaries of the Zionist institutions in Damascus that they, too, needed to turn to this medium in order to spread their message. Hence, they argued that there was a need to publish a newspaper reflecting a moderate and calming outlook that would draw Arabs and Jews nearer to and increase their understanding of the Zionist idea. The result of their activities in this area saw the founding of a bilingual, Hebrew and Arabic, newspaper, called ha-Mizrah/al-Sharq ('The East').

However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no data regarding musculoskeletal injuries. This article describes the musculoskeletal injuries that had ensued during the war of Troy. The Turkish translation of the original epic poem Iliad was reviewed for musculoskeletal injuries, that is, their descriptions, outcome, the weapons used, and the engaged warriors. Extremity injuries were evaluated as regards the affected bones. The pertinent treatment methods were also recorded. In total, 103 musculoskeletal injuries were detected during 81 combats. The most commonly involved areas were the shoulder (15.5%), the head (14.5%), the cervical vertebrae (14.5%), and the thoracic vertebrae (8.7%). The weapons used were spear (n = 52); sword (n = 9); arrow (n = 9); stone (n = 8); and cane, animal, the hand, Chariot race, and broken yoke (n = 1 for each). Fifty-four combats (66.6%) resulted in death. Therapeutic herbs, compound of milk, and essence of fig were used as treatment alternatives. While providing a historic snapshot on the war of Troy, in this article, the authors have reviewed the musculoskeletal injuries and their management in those ancient times. Despite the long period in between, unfortunately, physicians/surgeons are still faced with war injuries in current medical practice. The authors strongly hope that, at least in the near future, physicians will be left with only natural health problems and without those artificially generated by human beings. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Homer's Iliad; Musculoskeletal injuries; Troy","article; cultural anthropology; history; human; injury; literature; statistics; war; weapon; Greek World; History, Ancient; Humans; Medicine in Literature; Poetry as Topic; War; Weapons; Wounds and Injuries",,,08949115,,AJPRE,24406735,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897114288

From a heuristic viewpoint, it refers only to the ‘religious’ composition of the ‘ruling class’ (and, by the way, not even the whole of the ruling class). From a political viewpoint, it stresses the divisive elements present in the Indian historical tradition, by implicitly equating ‘Hindu’ with ‘Indian’ and ‘Muslim’ with ‘invader/foreigner’. The present article aims at sketching out a scientifically more inclusive and politically less dangerous new model by building on the assumption that Indian history is part of world history and, consequently, that the main socio-economic developments in the Indian subcontinent are part and parcel of the most relevant socio-economic developments world-wide. The resulting model de-emphasizes the divisive elements of the Indian experience, represented by the separate religious strands historically present within the Indian society, and, by focusing on socio-economic evolution, makes obvious both the fundamental unity of Indian history and its relationship with the history of the remainder of the world. © 2014, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

She displayed some eccentric tendencies that sometimes did not sit comfortably with her role as a medical professional; she was, for example, a believer in witchcraft and a convert to Roman Catholicism. However, she made great contributions to medicine throughout her active career and did so during a period in which female access to medical education was limited. Few of her female or male peers received such respect or oversaw such change.

Many of them hope that alcohol and drugs will enhance their creativity. Scientific studies are scarce and conclusions limited for methodological reasons. Furthermore, extraordinary creativity can hardly be grasped by empirical-statistical methods. Thus, ideographic studies are necessary to learn from extraordinarily creative persons about the relationship of creativity with alcohol and drugs. The pop icon Jim Morrison can serve as an exemplary case to investigate the interrelation between alcohol and drug abuse and creativity. Methods: Morrison's self-assessments in his works and letters as well as the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of creativity research. Results: In the lyrics of Jim Morrison and in biographical descriptions, we can see how Jim Morrison tried to cope with traumatic events, depressive moods and uncontrolled impulses through creative activities. His talent, skill and motivation to write creatively were independent from taking alcohol and drugs. He used alcohol and drugs to transgress restrictive social norms, to broaden his perceptions and to reinforce his struggle for self-actualization. In short, his motivation to create something new and authentic was reinforced by alcohol and drugs. More important was the influence of a supportive group that enabled Morrison's talents to flourish. However, soon the frequent use of high doses of alcohol and drugs weakened his capacity to realize creative motivation. Conclusions: Jim Morrison is an exemplary case showing that heavy drinking and the abuse of LSD, mescaline and amphetamines damages the capacity to realize creative motivation. Jim Morrison is typical of creative personalities like Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones and Jimmy Hendrix who burn their creativity in early adulthood through alcohol and drugs. We suppose that the sacrificial ritual of their decay offers some benefits for the excited spectators. One of these is the illusion that alcohol and drugs can lead to authenticity and creativity. © 2013 S.

Methods to attempt mythological resuscitation included use of hands (which may correlate with basic life support procedures), a kiss on the mouth (similar to mouthto- mouth resuscitation), application of burning torches (which might recall contemporary use of external defibrillators), and administration of drugs (a possible analogy to advanced life support procedures). A careful assessment of relevant myths demonstrated that interpretations other than medical might be more credible.CONCLUSIONS: Although several narratives of Greek mythology might suggest modern resuscitation techniques, they do not clearly indicate that ancient Greeks presaged scientific methods of resuscitation. Nevertheless, these elegant tales reflect humankind's optimism that a dying human might be restored to life if the appropriate procedures were implemented. Without this optimism, scientific improvement in the field of resuscitation might not have been achieved.

Using think-aloud interviews and card-sorting data, we engaged in qualitative analysis of how four preservice and five practicing teachers answered two questions related to determining significance: what events are most significant in world history and what events are most important for students to learn? Results showed that (a) participants answered the two questions differently, and (b) both practicing and preservice teachers added considerations when responding to the question about what events are most important for students to learn. Through these analyses, we developed the term instructional significance to describe an aspect of pedagogical content knowledge that serves as a lens through which teachers view the content they teach, and think about that content in preparing to teach students. We use these findings and research on student and teacher conceptions of historical significance to propose a preliminary framework for instructional significance for teaching history.

During World War I, entrusted with the management of the Maudsley neurological section, he sought to raise clinical standards and experimented with a range of therapies designed to treat the most severe or intractable forms of shell shock. While Mott believed that psychiatric disorder was underwritten by inherited characteristics, he did not dismiss the impact of the environment.

The remaining 90% of anaesthetics given in the USA were with diethyl ether. In the United Kingdom and elsewhere, chloroform was also popular. Diethyl ether administration was a relatively safe and simple procedure, often delegated to nurses or junior doctors with little or no specific training in anaesthesia. During the Japanese attack on the US bases at Pearl Harbor, with reduced stocks of diethyl ether available, intravenous Sodium Pentothal® , a most 'sophisticated and complex' drug, was used with devastating effects in many of those hypovolaemic, anaemic and septic patients. The hazards of spinal anaesthesia too were realised very quickly. These effects were compounded by the dearth of trained anaesthetists. This paper presents the significance of the anaesthesia tragedies at Pearl Harbor, and the discovery in the next few years of many other superior drugs which caused medical and other health professionals to realise that anaesthesia needed to be a specialist medical discipline in its own right. Specialist recognition soon followed, aided by the foundation of the National Health Service in the UK, the establishment of faculties of anaesthesia and appropriate training in pharmacology, physiology and other sciences. Modern anaesthesiology, as we understand it today, was born and a century or more of ether anaesthesia finally ceased.","Anaesthesiology; Pearl harbor; Pentothal®; Spinal anaesthesia","hexobarbital; procaine; tetracaine; thiopental; anesthetic agent; hexobarbital; thiopental; anesthesia; anesthesiology; critically ill patient; human; hypovolemia; intravenous anesthesia; neurosurgery; oxygen supply; respiratory arrest; Review; shock; spinal anesthesia; thorax surgery; war; anesthesia; anesthesiology; article; education; history; military medicine; mortality; Pearl Harbor; physician; United States; anaesthesiology; Pearl Harbor; Pentothal; spinal anaesthesia; Anesthesia; Anesthesiology; Anesthetics; Hawaii; Hexobarbital; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Medicine; Physicians; Thiopental; World War II",,,0310057X,,AINCB,25423385,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908041347

In 1914, thousands of Poles were conscripted into the Austrian, Prussian, and Russian armies and forced to fight against each other. When the war ended and Poland regained independence after more than one hundred years of partition, the fledgling government was unable to provide support for the more than three hundred thousand disabled war victims, not to mention the many civilians left injured or orphaned by the war. The vast majority of these victims were ex-servicemen of foreign armies, and were deprived of any war compensation. Neither the Polish government nor the impoverished society could meet the disabled ex-servicemen's medical and material needs; therefore, these men had to take responsibility for themselves and started cooperatives and war-invalids-owned enterprises. A social collaboration between Poland and America, rare in Europe at that time, was initiated by the Polish community in the United States to help blind ex-servicemen in Poland. © The Author 2012.","disability; disabled ex-serviceman; Eastern Front; Poland; war claims; World War I","community integration; disabled person; history; human; Jew; migration; pension; Poland; prisoner of war; social security; social welfare; soldier; statistics and numerical data; vulnerable population; war; Wounds and Injuries; Community Integration; Disabled Persons; Emigration and Immigration; Historiography; History, 20th Century; Humans; Jews; Military Personnel; Pensions; Poland; Prisoners of War; Social Security; Social Welfare; Vulnerable Populations; World War I; Wounds and Injuries",,,00225045,,JHMAA,22790322,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899872130

The research was based on the examination of exhumed skeletons of 202 men killed in World War II in the area of the Republic of Slovenia, and 243 men killed in the Bosnian War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The length measurements of the right and left humerus, femur, tibia and fibula were taken. Since the results revealed no significant differences and the left-sided bones were more complete and recurrent in the sample, the bones of the left side were used in the analysis. Since the increase in height depends mostly on the increase in length of the long bones, with an average absolute change of about 0.28 cm for humerus, 0.55 cm for femur, 0.49 cm for tibia and 0.20 cm for fibula per decade in our case, these results suggest a significant increase of the height of the Balkans population. The difference of the sum of the average femur and tibia length for the study period was 4.13 cm. Recalculated average length increase of the sum length of femur and tibia per decade was 0.88 cm for the left side.

At first glance, it is a paradox that the healing art is not pacific, but riddled with militaristic language and practices. On closer inspection, we find good reasons for this cultural paradox yet regret its presence. Drawing on insights from Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey, we argue for better understanding of confrontation, anger, bullying, intimidation and violence in medicine in order to change the culture. For example, equating medicine with war is not a given condition of medicine but a convenient metaphor with historical origins and a historical trajectory. Other, non-martial metaphors, such as medicine as collaboration, may be more appropriate in an age of team-based care. Taking lessons from Homer, we suggest three key ways in which cold-hearted confrontation and anger in medicine can be transformed into productive, warm-hearted engagement: the transformation of angry impulse into (1) reflection, (2) moral courage and (3) empathy. Thinking with Homer can offer an aesthetically and morally charged alternative to the current body of literature on topics, such as anger in doctors, and how this may be 'managed', without recourse to an instrumental economy where emotions are viewed as commodities, and emotional responses can be 'trained' through communication skills courses.",,"anger; cultural anthropology; doctor patient relation; empathy; history; human; language; literature; mental stress; morality; public figure; war; Anger; Empathy; Famous Persons; Greek World; History, Ancient; Humans; Language; Medicine in Literature; Metaphor; Morals; Mythology; Physician-Patient Relations; Poetry as Topic; Stress, Psychological; War",,,1468215X,,MHEUB,24194554,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901241159

A well-known expert on China and the Far East, Lattimore was a public intellectual and advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1950, after Senator Joseph McCarthy accused him of Soviet espionage, Lattimore's reputation was irrevocably damaged and his political thought forgotten. By assessing his visions of global democracy and geopolitics, this article claims Lattimore made insightful contributions to international thought. On the eve of the cold war, Lattimore's ideas of pluralistic democracy and tripolar world order offered an alternative vision of the post-war era, focusing on political participation and diversity. This article focuses on Lattimore's published writings in the 1940s, when, as political advisor and director of the Johns Hopkins Page School of International Relations, he sought to shift international attention from Europe to the Far East as the potential birthplace of a new version of post-colonial democracy.

In the nineteenth century Africa presented few states strong enough to resist the Western states with their newly organized nations, industrial economies and militaries. There were hardly any African states capable of imposing terms or even playing European powers off each other. As a consequence, Europeans were able to gang up, or agree to disagree, in carving the continent up in the 'scramble for Africa' without stepping on each other's toes.

Hurteau, the Commanding Officer of this Battalion, determined that the biggest task given to the Battalion during World War II, was establishing another hospital in the town of Hillersleben and providing additional beds in the existing hospital, which was a structure that had served as a boarding school. Furthermore, they needed to acquire hospital equipment which was obtained from German equipment and supplies that had been captured by the U.S. MiLitary. Also, they took care of obtaining food supplies from German warehouses, and meat and milk from local dairy farms.

For the French colonial administration, islam noir connoted the idea of a degraded Islam tainted by animist practices and therefore different from the pure Islam practiced in Arab countries. This differentiation was a way to separate it from 'Arab Islam', which was considered a subversive model. This distinction was not entirely new for it had already a long history behind it. Arabic sources had often shown a high distrust of sub-Saharan Africans who converted to Islam; they never really enjoyed a status equal to that of Arab Muslims. After the end of colonial rule, the story still continues. The theme of a specific sub-Saharan Islam (African Islam) remained a convenient category that was used by scholars, regardless of old prejudices. In the latest period, some African intellectuals have also embraced this concept, conjoining it with the pride of blackness, as a kind of Islam de la négritude, while praising its orthodoxy.

Hepatology 33:321-27, 2001). Although some patients have symptoms of acute hepatitis, most infected individuals are entirely asymptomatic. As a result, many patients are unaware of the infection until it progresses to chronic infection, and may not develop symptoms until decades later with the onset of decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A substantial proportion (20-40 %) of infected patients clear the virus during the acute phase. Interferon-based treatment is also much more likely to be successful in the acute phase of infection but is relatively poorly tolerated. Therefore, recognition of acute HCV infection is critical to prioritize those patients who do not spontaneously clear the infection for immediate therapy. However, the promise of highly effective well-tolerated all-oral therapies in development may alter the management approach.

To this, the user conventionally breaks down the tasks into a few co-dependent steps and issues multiple queries around these steps perpetually over long periods. To help users in their long-term information quests on the web, search engines maintain their queries and clicks while probing online. In order to give the search results quickly a shallow search will be made on the user history so that the results will be populated quickly. Pruning the search results can be done by various factors. The user will look for data that is more relevant to where the user is living. Another way would be to consider the most accessed contents. It analyses another approach to tackle the 'tiny target space' problem. This is based on the assumption that the user would never know that an item exists in the system if it is no way connected to the user. If the user gets to know the existence of some item, all those relevant to this item might interest the user. The recommendation space thus being smaller than the actual search space, it would be possible to search contents that are relevant to the user, but not all. So this can be used to show preliminary results to the user by the time the system fetches the entire results for the user. This would reduce the idle time the user spends on the system.

Funded by the Ministry of Information, Neuro Psychiatry was shot to convince influential clinicians and policy makers in North America that the British had developed expertise in the management of psychiatric casualties. By emphasizing novel and apparently effective interventions and excluding severe or intractable cases from the film, Wright encouraged an optimistic sense of achievement. Filmed at a time when victory was considered an eventual outcome, the picture presented a health service to which all had access without charge. Children and unemployed women, two groups excluded under the 1911 National Insurance Act, had been required to pay for healthcare in the prewar period and were shown receiving free treatment from the Emergency Medical Service. However, the therapeutic optimism presented in the film proved premature. Most U.K. battle casualties arose in the latter half of the conflict and follow-up studies failed to confirm the positive outcome statistics reported in the film.

Specific topics covered include pairing interpretive essays with groups of highly relevant images to engage students, incorporating responsive design to encourage use of mobile devices and creating an interactive map that links locations to digital content. Findings – By strengthening existing partnerships and proactively seeking new opportunities, libraries that do not have unique primary source collections can take a leading role in publishing digital history collections. Historians have been vital to the success of the Library’s digital projects, particularly those that incorporate multiple layers of historical context.

This paper interprets from the U.S. experience with national highway construction, drawing several lessons that are pertinent both in developing and developed countries. In the U.S., the 1956 Interstate Highway Act codified a national road building program with centralized, federal leadership, financed by fuel taxes and hence designed to serve motorists, with little appreciation for the resulting impacts on cities and metropolitan areas. The U.S. experience illustrates that national transportation planning is best conceived as two systems - one inter-metropolitan and one intra-metropolitan - and that the institutions, goals, methods, and financing instruments for those two systems should differ. The U.S. institutions and policies were well suited to building a national, inter-metropolitan ground transport system, but are ill suited to the era of maintenance, externality management, and urban transportation that followed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Developing countries; Interstate highways; Transportation history","developing world; metropolitan area; road construction; road transport; transportation planning; transportation policy; urban transport; United States",,,0967070X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891445613

The article aims to give a path for further analysis on the poetry written after the 1990s which is a period that offered different and very important perspectives for Albanian literature. The development of Albanian poetry during this time and during the first decades of the 21st century, as well as its representation abroad through translation, is closely linked to the name of one of the main spokespersons of contemporary Albanian poetry Luljeta Lleshanaku. The article focuses on the poetic images and perceptions of history in Lleshanaku’s poetry and analyzes the specific poetic images and literary configurations deriving from it. The paper also designates a possible path of comparative approach with the poetry of an eminent Israeli writer of the second half of the twentieth century such as Yehuda Amichai, which is probably one of the most important influences in Lleshanaku’s poetics. The vision about the world and particularly the vision on history as well as the artistic sensitivity that are a constant underscoring of the poetic images of Lleshanaku’s and Amichai’s poetry seem to approach two poets that belong to different cultural, political and social contexts. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.","Contemporary poetry; History; Memory; Poetry; World literature",,,,20399340,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907284197

In this study, we explored the association between PP and presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients with TAAAD. PP at hospital presentation was used to divide 1,960 patients with noniatrogenic TAAAD into quartiles: narrowed (≤39 mm Hg, n = 430), normal (40 to 56 mm Hg, n = 554), mildly elevated (57 to 75 mm Hg, n = 490), and markedly elevated (≥76 mm Hg, n = 486). Variables relating to index presentation and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed. Patients with TAAAD in the narrowed PP quartiles were frequently older and Caucasian, whereas patients with markedly elevated PPs tended to be male and have a history of hypertension. Patients who demonstrated abdominal vessel involvement more commonly demonstrated elevated PPs, whereas patients with narrowed PPs were more likely to have periaortic hematoma and/or pericardial effusion. Narrowed PPs were also correlated with greater incidences of hypotension, cardiac tamponade, and mortality. Patients with TAAAD who were managed with endovascular and hybrid procedures and those with renal failure tended to have markedly elevated PPs. No difference in aortic regurgitation at presentation was noted among groups. In conclusion, patients with TAAAD in the third PP quartile had better in-hospital outcomes than patients in the lowest quartile. Patients with narrowed PPs experienced more cardiac complications, particularly cardiac tamponade, whereas those with markedly elevated PPs were more likely to have abdominal aortic involvement. Presenting PP offers a clue to different manifestations of acute aortic dissection that may facilitate initial triage and care. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to determine associations between predominant type of formula used from birth to 4 months and parental and child characteristics and type of physician consulted, and then to describe relations between type of formula used and growth. Our analyses included 1349 infants from the EDEN mother-child cohort. Infant's feeding mode and type of formula used were assessed at 4 months by maternal self-report. Infant's weight and height from birth to 4 months, measured in routine follow-up, were documented by health professionals in the infant's personal health record. Anthropometric z-scores were calculated by using World Health Organization growth standards. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the type of formula predominantly used; relations with growth were analysed by linear regressions. Partially hydrolysed formulas were more likely to be used by primiparous women (P<0.001), those breastfeeding longer (P<0.001) and for infants with family history of allergies (P=0.002). Thickened formulas were more often used by mothers returning to employment in the first 4 months (P=0.05) and breastfeeding shortly (P<0.001). No significant relation was found between infant's growth and type of formula (P>0.20). Infants breastfed shorter showed higher weight-for-age (P<0.001) and length-for-age (P=0.001) z-score changes between birth and 4 months.

While Islamophobia continues to shape some domestic policies of Western states and provide ideological justification for the wars they wage abroad, ‘Islamophilic’ tendencies in foreign policy have also emerged, especially in responses to the ‘Arab Spring’. Not clearly noted in Western public discourse, this represents a historical continuation of Western support for Islamism common during the Cold War, but is also a shift from the Islamophobic discourse of the post-cold war period, especially since 9/11. While Islamophobic and Islamophilic discourses may appear to be opposites, the paper argues that they represent two sides of the Orientalist logic, continuing to reduce understanding of Middle Eastern societies and politics to a culturalist dimension. Unlike traditional Orientalism, they treat Middle Eastern people as political subjects, but approach them as defined by their culture and religion. They define ‘moderate’ Islamism as the typical (and preferred) politics of the people of the region. Focusing on specific recent developments, the paper suggests that, rather than paving the way to more peaceful relations with the region or to internal peace and stability there, the Islamophilic shift in Western policy may rather lead to new waves of catastrophes by further destabilising and fragmenting the region, threatening to evoke new waves of Islamophobia in the West. © 2014, © 2014 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.","Islamophilia; Islamophobia; Orientalism; US foreign policy; war on terror; ‘Arab Spring’; ‘moderate Islam’","Arab world; Cold War; cultural history; foreign policy; historical perspective; Islamism; religion; Middle East",,,01436597,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911095519

Design: Nested case-control study. Setting: This analysis was randomly selected from all elderly beneficiaries in 2007-2008, and represents some 30% of the whole older insurers using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Participants: We identified 5933 cases newly admitted for fall-related fractures during 2007-2008, and 29 665 random controls free from fracture. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Polypharmacy was defined as the use of fall-related drugs of four or more categories of medications and prescribed related to fall within a 1-year period. Logistic regression models were employed to estimate the ORs and related 95% CIs. The interaction of polypharmacy with age and sex was assessed separately. Results: Compared with those who consumed no category of medication, older people who consumed 1, 2, 3 and ≥4 categories of medications were all at significantly increased odds of developing fall-related fractures, with a significant dose-gradient pattern (β=0.7953; p for trend <0.0001). There were significant interactions between polypharmacy and age, but no significant interactions between polypharmacy and gender. The dose-gradient relationship between number of medications category and risk of fall-related fractures was more obvious in women than in men (β=0.1962 vs β=0.1873). Additionally, it was most evident in older people aged 75-84 years (β=0.2338). Conclusions: This population-based study in Taiwan confirms the link between polypharmacy and increased risk of fall-related fractures in older people; and highlights that elderly women and older people aged 75-84 years will be the targeted participants for further prevention from fall-related fractures caused by polypharmacy.",,"antiarrhythmic agent; anticoagulant agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antiparkinson agent; anxiolytic agent; cardiac glycoside; diuretic agent; gastrointestinal agent; hypnotic sedative agent; insulin; neuroleptic agent; nitrate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; vitamin; prescription drug; age; aged; article; case control study; controlled study; disease association; fall related fracture; falling; female; fracture; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; national health insurance; polypharmacy; prescription; risk assessment; risk factor; sex; Taiwan; world health organization; Fractures, Bone; hospitalization; odds ratio; sex difference; statistical model; very elderly; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Female; Fractures, Bone; Hospitalization; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Polypharmacy; Prescription Drugs; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Taiwan",,,20446055,,,24682575,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897492408

It was in the 1960s that aI-'Alawi began his career as a prolific writer, exploring turath through a new prism that highlighted its 'subversive' elements, particularly with regard to class conflict, the role of the intellectual and his relation to the state, the relationship between language and the subconscious, anti-clericalism, history and myth, feminism, the modernization of the Arabic language and, later, the necessity of spiritualizing or indigenizing the application of communism. Al-Alawi was initially appreciative of China's Maoist model of communism because of what he saw as its successful reconciliation of Chinese traditional culture (oral and textual) with scientific Marxism. This synthesis, he believed, allowed Maoism to overcome the country's essential challenge of feeding its people and achieving industrialization, as embodied in the Great Leap Forward.",,"Arab world; civilization; communism; cultural tradition; feminism; modernization; party politics; social history; China; Middle East",,,08992851,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902688900

By analyzing individual tweet collections, we find that what are suitable for inclusion in the personal timeline should be tweets talking about personal (as opposed to public) and time-specific (as opposed to time-general) topics. To further extract these types of topics, we introduce a non-parametric multi-level Dirichlet Process model to recognize four types of tweets: personal time-specific (PersonTS), personal time-general (PersonTG), public time-specific (PublicTS) and public time-general (PublicTG) topics, which, in turn, are used for further personal event extraction and timeline generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focused on the generation of timeline for individuals from Twitter data. For evaluation, we have built gold standard timelines that contain PIE related events from 20 ordinary twitter users and 20 celebrities. Experimental results demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically extract chronological timelines for Twitter users from their tweet collection 1.

Methods: A wide-ranging literature search was undertaken that encompassed peer-reviewed journals, non-refereed publications, books, official publications, newspapers and archived documents. Results: Thirty-one aircrew are known to have worn sealed scleral lenses in order to meet the required visual standards. Of these, only two were considered to be completely unsuccessful, one of whom was unilaterally aphakic. One additional case of undisclosed contact lens wear was found and the identity of this officer was established. Brief biographies of a few pilots establish the context of their contact lens wear. Conclusion: Overall, the results of scleral lens wear were variable reflecting those achieved by civilian patients of the period. While three men complained of discomfort due to heat and glare, one pilot experienced no photophobia when flying above white clouds in brilliant sunshine and another found no difficulty caused by altitude or tropical climate. Wearing time ranged from about 2. h to 16, or more, hours. In about a third of the cases, wearing time was limited due to the onset of a form of contact lens induced-epithelial oedema known as Sattler's veil and effective solutions to this problem were not implemented until after the war. © 2013 British Contact Lens Association.","Aircrew; Aviation; Royal Air Force; Scleral contact lenses; World War II","air force; airplane crew; altitude; aphakia; article; aviation; clinical effectiveness; contact lens; eye discomfort; eye edema; human; literature; photophobia; priority journal; Sattlers veil; sclera; tropic climate; visual acuity; war; Aircrew; Aviation; Royal Air Force; Scleral contact lenses; World War II; Contact Lenses; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; Refractive Errors; World War II",,,13670484,,CLAEA,24001797,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894681959

During surgery, the tumor ruptured, leading to fragmented and incomplete resection. The morphological and immunohistochemical aspects suggested thyroid SVS, which was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (SYT gene rearrangement). The patient experienced immediate local relapse in close contact with large vessels and the thyroid cartilage and was referred to our institution. Doxorubicin-ifosfamide chemotherapy led to a minor response that authorized secondary conservative surgery. Because of microscopically incomplete resection, adjuvant radiotherapy was chosen and is ongoing 10 months after initial surgery. The prognosis of thyroid SVS is associated with a high risk for local and metastatic relapses. Pretreatment diagnosis is fundamental and may benefit from molecular analysis.

Methods Included patients were 65 years of age or older, were living in nursing homes or in their own home with care provided by the community nursing system and had been admitted to hospital. The patients' medication lists from the community were compared with the hospital medication lists upon admission in order to study the discrepancies between the lists. The proportion of errors that were corrected by day 4 of hospitalisation was also studied as a measure of the effect of medication reconciliation conducted by clinical pharmacists who aimed to identify the patients' accurate and complete medication history. Results A total of 149 patients were included over a 10-month period. In 68 (46%) patients, there occurred at least one medication error, with an average of 0.95 errors per patient. Overall, 8.0% of all drug transfers were found to be incorrect. The clinical pharmacists detected all medication errors upon admission and 43% of them were corrected before day 4 of hospitalisation. Conclusions Medication errors upon admission to hospital are common; use of clinical pharmacists in the admission medication reconciliation process appears to be a useful method to reduce medication errors, but since our study lacked a control group further studies are needed to show the actual impact of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation upon admission to hospital. Furthermore, more actions are needed to enhance the safety and quality of medication information transfers.",,"aged; article; community assessment; drug absorption; female; general practitioner; home care; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospital organization; human; internal medicine; major clinical study; male; medical history; medication error; medication therapy management; nursing home; nursing information system; outcome assessment; pharmacist attitude; Sweden; world health organization; Article; cardiovascular system; central nervous system; hematopoietic system; hospitalization; information processing; medical information; medical record; pharmacist; prescription; respiratory system; very elderly",,,20479956,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901266149

Occupied countries contributed between 25 and 30% of the total German war costs. According to recent calculations, the Norwegian contribution has been between 6 and 7% of the occupied countries' total contribution; per capita the Norwegian war tribute was twice the average of the occupied West-European countries. The main aim of the paper is to explain how the relatively large Norwegian contribution came about by focusing on the institutional arrangements of financial transfers. The role of the central bank, Norges Bank, and its relationship with its German supervisory authority during the occupation is particularly important. The accommodating behaviour of Norges Bank (NB) and the shrewd institutional set-up and actual operandi of the monetary and financial occupation regime in Norway, based on indirect governance, served German interests better than the more frequent use of direct rule and open inference in the equivalent domestic institutions in Belgium, France and The Netherlands. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","central bank; German occupation; Norway; occupation payments; Second World War","central bank; economic history; financial market; governance approach; institutional framework; occupation; war; Belgium; France; Netherlands; Norway","NB, New Balance",,03585522,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898013000

Following the ISLSM lead, a large number of national and international societies were very swiftly formed. As the number grew, it became obvious that some sort of linking forum would help all these separate societies to pool the knowledge of their members for the good of the clinicians and their patients. The World Federation of Societies for Laser Medicine and Surgery was formed to attempt to fill this role. The History: At the 1996 meeting of the Greek Medical Laser Association, the first international forum of representatives from 17 international and national laser societies was convened by Professor Nick Nicolopoulos, and the seed of an idea for a centralized forum to help separate laser societies coordinate efforts and knowledge was planted. This seed was nurtured by the ISLSM as the first medical laser society, and forums were called together at each meeting of the ISLSM and the other related societies from 1997 to 2003. At the 2004 Chinese Medical Laser Society meeting, the idea of worldwide federation of laser societies crystallized into a more tangible form. The Inaugural WFSLMS Congress: The convening of the first WFSLMS congress took place in Tokyo in 2005, under the leadership of Professor Kazuhiko Atsumi. At this meeting, Professor Kaplan proposed that a Medical Laser Foundation should be established and donated the first seed money for its formation. Because of the Japanese legal requirements, a foundation was impossible and so a Non-profit Organization (NPO-WFSLMS) was started, based in Japan, to oversee the work and fund the tasks of promoting laser surgery and medicine worldwide, for the good of mankind: the financing, running and holding WFSLMS congresses became one of the tasks of NPO-WFSLMS. Conclusion: Both the WFSLMS and NPO-WFSLMS were therefore on their way to working together for a cohesive approach to try and coordinate the work of all societies dedicated to laser medicine and surgery under the WFSLMS umbrella, with NPO-WFSLMS continuously gathering, administering and disbursing the funds to allow the WFSLMS to run its 4-yearly meetings. © 2014 JMLL, Tokyo, Japan.",,"conference paper; funding; health care organization; history of medicine; human; international cooperation; International Society for Laser Surgery and Medicine; knowledge base; laser surgery; licensing; medical education; medical literature; medical society; non profit organization; organization and management; public health; World Federation of Societies for Laser Medicine and Surgery",,,08985901,,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940237108

The World Health Organization criteria were established to standardize the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with serrated polyposis. Although useful, the criteria may not be ideal for the initial screening of at-risk populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the use of a minimal cutoff point of serrated lesions to increase the yield of serrated polyposis cases. DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of colonoscopy and pathology reports to identify patients who met the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis. SETTING: This study was conducted at a tertiary cancer care referral center. PATIENTS: Five hundred patients who had at least 2 pathologically confirmed hyperplastic polyps and/or sessile serrated adenomas/polyps diagnosed between 1999 and 2009 were assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the number of serrated polyposis cases. RESULTS: Forty of the 500 (8%) patients met the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome. Patients underwent a median of 4 colonoscopies (range, 1-23) before satisfying the criteria, and only 1 (3%) patient met the criteria for diagnosis during the initial colonoscopy. All 16 patients with a history of colorectal cancer were only diagnosed with serrated polyposis either at the time of their cancer diagnosis or during postoperative colonoscopies. Only 5 of the 40 (13%) patients were enrolled in our institutional Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Family Registry before our study for prospective serrated lesion tracking and colorectal cancer screening. LIMITATIONS: This tool requires validation in a prospective setting. CONCLUSIONS: The cutoff point of at least 2 pathologically confirmed serrated lesions can serve as a screening tool for identifying patients meeting the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome who would otherwise go undetected. © The ASCRS 2014.","Colorectal cancer; Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes; Hyperplastic polyposis; Serrated polyposis","adult; aged; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; colon polyposis; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; Conference Paper; female; health care organization; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical record review; pathology; polyp hyperplasia; postoperative period; rare disease; rectum adenoma; serrated polyposis syndrome; very elderly; article; evaluation study; gastrointestinal polyposis; middle aged; practice guideline; retrospective study; syndrome; world health organization; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colonoscopy; Female; Humans; Intestinal Polyposis; Male; Middle Aged; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Retrospective Studies; Syndrome; World Health Organization",,,00123706,,DICRA,24901685,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904573129

A 52-year-old female patient with a history of polycythaemia vera under treatment with hydroxyurea and phlebotomy presented in our outpatient clinic with newly diagnosed hypertension caused by left renal artery stenosis. Six months after stenting, patient returned for a follow-up visit due to uncontrolled hypertension and high haematocrit levels. Total restenosis of the left renal artery was found. Patient received optical medical treatment and was prescribed to higher doses of hydroxyurea by her treating haematologist. Since then, blood pressure and Hct levels remain adequately controlled. As described by earlier case reports, renal artery stenosis, hypertension and polycythemia often coexist. However, renovascular hypertension may not only lead to secondary erythrocytosis but also be a thrombotic complication of primary erythrocytosis.

The article draws attention to the very modern thinking on treatment of war neuroses, far ahead of the average standards of the day, evinced by Prof. Piltz and his team. The most important innovative elements of their treatment of these conditions were the fact that they perceived the cause of the neurosis to lie in previous personality disorders in the patients, their recommendation of psychotherapy as the main method of treatment, and their emphasis on the need for further rehabilitation following the completion of the course of hospital treatment.

These materials provided the basis for an original social interpretation of the history of cartography as a critical discipline endowed with a social utility, as well as an opportunity to explore a different way of conceiving maps and geography, diverging from the uncritical hagiographies of geographical discoveries and cartographic accuracy which were typical of the time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Charles Perron; Élisée Reclus; Geographical education; History of cartography; Maps of the world","geography education; historical cartography; map; Middle Ages; museum; twentieth century; Geneva [Switzerland]; Switzerland","SNSF, Swiss National Science Foundation",,03057488,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892791409

The American author made no reference to Canada's war efforts. The subsequent public discussion focused on issues of patriotism, citizenship, history education and schooling, but it eventually dissolved into longstanding conflicts over language and religion. This case study investigates how questions about history education were interpreted through the lens of the political partisanship of the newspaper editor, the bureaucratic rationality of the educational administrator, and the Acadian nationalism of the Roman Catholic Bishop. The controversy depicts a loosening but not breaking of postcolonial ties, and uncovers the political nature of public memory, along with the complex intertwining of religion and language rights within schooling, history education and citizenship in post-war Canada and New Brunswick. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","education; First World War; history; New Brunswick; textbooks",,,,0046760X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892402051

PFP such as albumin, blood coagulation factors, and immunoglobulins are derived from blood collected from thousands of people. PFP have been listed since the first edition of the EML (1977). However, the PFP listed on the EML have changed dramatically because EML's selection process has changed from experience-based to evidence-based. For example, albumin, which had been listed since the 2nd edition (1979), was deleted in the 11th edition (2000) because of the uncertainty of its efficacy. Human immunoglobulin normal, which had been deleted from the 13th edition (2003), was relisted in the 15th edition (2007). Moreover, the WHO has issued several resolutions and guidelines regarding PFP production, quality, and safety in order to promote the establishment of blood programmes in every nation. The focus of WHO's EML selection process has changed over 30 years. In the 20th century, WHO mainly focused on PFP efficacy, quality, and safety problems. However, currently the focus is on the problem of PFP accessibility, especially in developing countries. Therefore, it would be important to know how to capitalize on established knowledge and production technology to increase the accessibility of PFP worldwide. © 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","Blood product; Blood programme; History; Plasma fractionation product; WHO model list of essential medicines","albumin; blood clotting factor; immunoglobulin; albuminoid; biological product; blood clotting factor; essential drug; immunoglobulin; blood safety; fractionation; knowledge; medicine; plasma fractionation; practice guideline; review; world health organization; human; plasma; world health organization; Albumins; Biological Products; Blood Coagulation Factors; Drugs, Essential; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Plasma; World Health Organization",,,00316903,,YKKZA,24369307,"Japanese",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907294769

In his search for gratification, man has discovered a world of substances that intoxicated him. Those who fell within its trap, their life changed, their families aggrieved and they shrank from company. The addiction remained alone in the end. To many death was a relief. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Catchment area of UHTC (Urban Health and training Centre) where all males aged ≥15 years residing in the study area were included. Data was collected by home visit using WHO questionnaire (AUDIT: Alcohol use disorder identification test) Modified Kuppuswamy scale was used to assess the socio-economic status of the families. Data was analyzed by appropriate test using SPSS 20.0 version. Logistic regression was applied to the positively associated results. Results: According to the AUDIT score, Hazardous, Dependent and harmful drinkers were 7.7%, 9.2% and 2.4% respectively. Age, marital status, education of the head of the family,occupation of the respondent, caste, family history of alcohol use had statistically significant association (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval). Logistic regression was applied and marital status, family history of alcohol use and caste retained their statistical significance (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval). Conclusions: It can be concluded that being young, being low educated, being married and having a family history of alcohol use are more at risk to it. This indicates the dire necessity to consider the above factors in order to combat with this evil of alcohol use.","AUDIT; Harmful and dependent users; Hazardous; Independent association socio-demographic determinants; Prevalence of alcohol use; WHO questionnaire","adolescent; adult; age distribution; alcohol consumption; Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; alcoholism; article; cross-sectional study; demography; educational status; family history; family size; health service; human; income; India; major clinical study; male; marriage; Modified Kuppuswamy scale; occupation; questionnaire; residential care; social status; urban area; world health organization",,,20087802,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902988527

In ""The Philosophy of History in the 'Later' Nishida,"" Woo-Sung Huh claims that Nishida Kitaro's attempt to integrate history into his earlier writings on self-consciousness is a ""wrong turn."" I will demonstrate how Huh's criticism of Nishida's writings on history stems from Huh's own ontological assumption that consciousness and the historical world occupy distinct realms. Leveling this criticism against Nishida causes the reader to miss Nishida's greatest insight, namely that there is no such distinction; there is only one reality of consciousness and materiality. Nishida's emphasis on the historical world makes his earlier claim that consciousness is inseparable from things more robust. I will argue that by expanding his earlier focus on consciousness to include the formative power of created physical objects and human bodies on consciousness, Nishida's philosophy is actually strengthened. © W.

Cars and trucks were noisier than today, and the horn was used more frequently. This led to loud protests and anti-noise campaigns, which have been discussed by historians in studies of the evolution of traffic noise in the twentieth century. In this article we first describe the situation around 1930 from a historical point of view, and next we present an approximate quantitative assessment of traffic noise around 1930, including horn noise, focusing on the city of Amsterdam. Noise maps of Amsterdam are presented for cars, trucks, and horns in 1930, and for comparison also for cars and trucks in 2012. The noise maps for 1930 are based on detailed traffic data for Amsterdam in 1930, which were derived from two reports published in 1934 and 1940 about an extensive traffic count in Amsterdam in 1930. The traffic count was carried out in the framework of the Amsterdam Expansion Plan of 1934. The results of the traffic noise analysis presented here are discussed in the light of expectations around 1930 about future developments of Amsterdam, as well as in the wider context of sprawling cities after World War II. The results also put today's approach of traffic noise mapping and annoyance assessment in perspective. © 2014 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.",,"Acoustic noise; Automobiles; History; Military operations; Trucks; Anti noise; Expansion plans; Quantitative assessments; Traffic counts; Traffic data; Traffic noise; Twentieth century; World war II; Noise pollution",,,07362501,,NCEJD,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920621969

The efforts of Ma Dexin (1794-1874) exemplify this shift to strengthen ties with the Muslim community outside China and situate Sino-Islamic scholarship in widespread Islamic discourses. Ma's writings provided Sino-Muslims with discursive and pragmatic tools for engaging a global Muslim community. For Ma, Muslim cooperation was negotiated through the means of religious education, which was enabled through travel and language. In this paper, I demonstrate how Ma Dexin modelled the importance of global connections of inter-Asian networks of religious learning by exemplifying the value of Middle Eastern travel and fluency in Arabic. I employ Ma's Chinese and Arabic written works in relation to those of Wang Daiyu (circa 1590-1658) and Liu Zhi (circa 1670-1724) to illustrate how he differed significantly from previous Sino-Muslim authors with regard to the use of Arabic within the Sino-Islamic intellectual tradition and in his emphatic urgings to perform the hajj pilgrimage. Finally, I briefly show how his divergent position was embraced, as exhibited through the efforts of one of his intellectual inheritors, Ma Lianyuan (1841-1903).

While diverse, this literature may be divided into several general groups. The first comprises studies written by Western and Israeli scholars and encompasses a broad spectrum of Arabic-speaking countries. This literature has explored, among other things, issues relating to the way of life and administration of ethnically and culturally diverse Jewish communities, their approaches to Zionism and the question of their national identities, their positions regarding the Zionist-Israeli-Arab conflict in its various phases, and the phenomena of anti-Semitism, particularly in light of the increasing escalation of the conflict. It includes works by Israeli intellectuals of Mizrahi heritage, some of whom came together in the late 1990s in a sociopolitical dissident movement known as the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition. The target audience of this movement was Mizrahi Jews: refugees and emigrants from Arab countries as well as their second-and third-generation offspring. The movement, which was not ideologically homogeneous (particularly regarding approaches to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict), took a postcolonialist approach to the Zionist narrative and enterprise, and was critical of the entrenchment of the Ashkenazi (European-extraction) Jews among the elites of the emerging Israeli society. The movement had scant success in reaching its target population: the majority of Mizrahi/Sephardi Jews living in Israel. Nevertheless, it brought to the fore the historical socioeconomic injustices that many Jews from Arab countries had experienced since arriving in Israel, whether reluctantly or acquiescently. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.",,"Arab world; cultural history; cultural identity; cultural landscape; cultural relations; ethnic minority; historical geography; Judaism; social movement; national identity; religion; Egypt",,,00207438,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904658040

Medical College, Agra. One hundred and twenty seven HIV infected children aged ≤ 15 y were included in the study. Enroled children were randomized to receive micronutrients for 6 mo or probiotics for 3 mo. Children who did not receive supplements served as control. Change in WHO clinical stage, immunological stage, CD4 counts and body mass index (BMI) status were taken at the end of 6 mo. In probiotic group, mean CD4 count were taken as outcome measure. A detailed history, examination and WHO clinical staging were recorded for all the patients.Results: In micronutrient supplemented group (not on ART), significant improvement was seen in WHO clinical staging (p = 0.049) when compared to controls after 6 mo. Probiotic supplemented group showed significant increase in CD4 counts compared to control group (p = 0.0022) in children &gt;5 y. Control group showed significant decline in CD4 count in children ≤5 y (−65.3 cells/mm3, p=0.005) and in children &gt;5 y (−87.9 cells/mm3, p=0.05) after 12 wk of supplementation.Conclusions: Probiotics supplementation has shown significant improvement in CD4 counts. Micronutrients supplementation has shown significant delay in the progression towards advance stage of disease. © 2014, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","HIV; Micronutrients; Probiotics","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; cotrimoxazole; multivitamin; probiotic agent; trace element; Article; body mass; CD4 lymphocyte count; child; controlled study; diarrhea; female; follow up; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunological stage; major clinical study; male; medical examination; medical history; otitis media; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; skin infection; staging; tuberculosis; vitamin supplementation; world health organization clinical stage",,,00195456,,IJPEA,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907493107

Brazil will host the 2014 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. This paper represents the first results from Project Prepara Brasil, which is investigating the preparedness of the health sector and pharmaceutical services for these events. Hypothesis/Problem This study was designed to identify the efforts engaged in to prepare the health sector in Brazil for the FIFA World Cup 2014 event, as well as the 2016 Summer Olympics. Methods Key informant interviews were conducted with representatives of both the municipality and hospital sectors in each of the 12 host cities where matches will be played. A semi-structured key informant interview guide was developed, with sections for each type of participant. One of each municipality's reference hospitals was identified and seven additional general hospitals were randomly selected from all of the inpatient facilities in each municipality. The interviewers were instructed to contact a reference hospital, and two of the other hospitals, in the jurisdiction for participation in the study. Questions were asked about plans for mass-gathering events, the interaction between hospitals and government officials in preparation for the World Cup, and their perceptions of their surge capacity to meet the potential demands generated by the presence of the World Cup events in their municipalities. Results In all, 11 representatives of the sampled reference hospitals, and 24 representatives of other general private and public hospitals in the municipalities, were interviewed. Most of the hospitals had some interaction with government officials in preparation for the World Cup 2014. Approximately one-third (34%) received training activities from the government. Fifty-four percent (54%) of hospitals had no specific plans for communicating with the government or other agencies during the World Cup. Approximately half (51%) had plans for surge capacity during the event, but only 27% had any surge capacity for isolation of potentially infectious patients. Conclusion Overall, although there has been mention of a great deal of planning on the part of the government officials for the World Cup 2014, hospital surge to meet the potential increase in demand still falls short. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2014.","hospital preparedness; mass gatherings; surge capacity; World Cup","article; Brazil; disaster planning; emergency health service; history; human; mass disaster; organization and management; soccer; sport; surge capacity; Anniversaries and Special Events; Brazil; Disaster Planning; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Mass Casualty Incidents; Soccer; Sports; Surge Capacity",,,1049023X,,,25007076,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908242090

Since the millennium, he has sought to clarify his own vision of modern capitalism at a time when western hegemony is coming under pressure from globalization. Yet this achievement has not received the recognition from anthropologists that it deserves. This article, in reviewing six books published during the last decade, makes a case for reassessing Goody's project from the mid-1970s until now. It singles out two books for special attention, The Theft of History and his latest volume, Metals, Culture and Capitalism. A consistent theme of his recent work is to juxtapose his own account of the history of western capitalism with those of Marx, Weber and other writers in the classical tradition of social theory. Jack Goody remains to this day an anthropologist whose sensibility was formed by long-term ethnographic fieldwork. But he knew that, if he aspired to throw light on the human predicament as a whole, he would have to become a world historian too. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","capitalism; Eurasia; metals; Renaissance; the West; world history",,,,00938157,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906315106

This changing concept has prompted a subsequent re-evaluation of what constitutes the outstanding universal values of World Heritage sites and the operational methods for implementing the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. The scope has broadened from studying a single monument in isolation to one that values a multidimensional, multiregional, and inter-disciplinary approach and encapsulates vast spans of human history. Within this broader view, landslides and more generally slope instabilities are an important factor endangering cultural heritage sites, especially prehistoric sites, earth/rock monuments, and archaeological sites affected by environmental processes and degradation. Natural and cultural heritage sites, as well as cultural landscapes, are then tied into a common framework that the Geological Society of America has defined “Men’s legacy to Earth and Earth’s legacy to Man”. On the other hand, not too much effort has been expended in the past to develop conservation policies systematically integrating geological, geomorphological, and engineering geological aspects into daily practices. The purpose of the “LAndslides and CUltural & Natural HEritage” thematic Network (LACUNHEN) is to create a platform for scientists and practitioners who are ready to jointly contribute to safeguarding relevant endangered Natural and Cultural Heritage sites (e.g., Machu Picchu).

Historians and the Apollo participants themselves agree that an essential factor in the success of the lunar missions was the 'team' circumstances that prevailed. Hence, it is historically valuable to identify those team members who began their space careers in Germany and, after World War II. came to the United States and ultimately provided the experienced core of the Apollo rocket transportation team. It is informative to compile three lists of these core team members. The first list has those individuals who worked and gained experience in Peenemuende and who subsequently came to Huntsville, Alabama to work for the U.S. Army. The majority of them held advanced degrees from prestigious European universities. In the process of leading the development of the Redstone, Mercury-Redstone, Jupiter and Juno rockets, they mentored a large number of native U.S. citizens and some selected immigrants. This first list is arbitrarily titled ""Rocketry Mentors'. The second list has those Rocketry Mentors who subsequently were at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, or at the Kennedy Space Center after its formation, during the 1960's when the Saturn-Apollo rockets were developed and used to carry men to the Moon. During this decade, this core of rocketry professionals was by then very experienced in execution of new rocket developments and uses. Thus, this second list is titled 'Rocketry Practitioners'. The third list has those few Rocketry Practitioners who, prior to their participation in developments in Peenemuende. were involved in the early rocket investigations at either Rakentenflugplatz or Kummersdorf. In their lifetime, and with their active participation, these individuals had the unique opportunity of seeing youthful dreams realized when mankind first traveled successfully and repeatedly to another body in our Solar System. This list is therefore titled the 'Unique Space Pioneers'.",,"History; Interplanetary flight; Lunar missions; Military operations; Moon; NASA; Space flight; Space platforms; Thermal barrier coatings; Core teams; European universities; Kennedy space centers; NASA Marshall; Rocket development; Space pioneers; Team members; World war II; Rockets",,,00741795,9781634399869,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938153161

Novice maintainers may lack the historical knowledge required to efficiently manage an inherited system. While some libraries are regularly updated, some systems keep a dependency on older versions. On the other hand, maintainers may be unaware that other systems have settled on a different version of a library. In this paper, we visualize how the dependency relation between a system and its dependencies evolves from two perspectives. Our system-centric dependency plots (SDP) visualize the successive library versions a system depends on over time. The radial layout and heat-map metaphor provide visual clues about the change in dependencies along the system's release history. From this perspective, maintainers can navigate to a library-centric dependants diffusion plot (LDP). The LDP is a time-series visualization that shows the diffusion of users across the different versions of a library. We demonstrate on real-world systems how maintainers can benefit from our visualizations through four case scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.","Software Evolution; Software Maintenance; Software Reuse","Computer software maintenance; Visualization; Dependency relation; Heat maps; Real-world system; Release history; Software Evolution; System centric; Time series visualization; Visual clues; Computer software reusability",,,,9780769553054,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920673605

During the course of the Anfa Conference, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) had a private dinner with Sultan Mohamed ben Youssef, which came to change the course of Moroccan history. Although the details of the conversation between the two statesmen remained shrouded in mystery due to FDR's untimely death just two years later, the Moroccan side later claimed that the American leader had promised to support their country's independence once the Second World War had ended. This article sheds fresh light on both the meeting and its impact on the trajectory of Moroccan history by utilising a number of new sources. It argues that the Sultan and the local nationalist movement seized this opportunity and created a ‘Roosevelt Myth’, thus turning FDR into a saint-like figure whose anti-colonial stance legitimised their own aspirations to abolish the French and Spanish Protectorates established in 1912. Until they finally obtained complete independence in 1956, the Moroccans used FDR's supposed promise to convince the highly reluctant US diplomats and politicians to support their anti-colonial struggle. The meeting between Roosevelt and Sidi Mohamed became one of the central elements of the national historical narrative, and the memory of the late President is still very much alive in the political discourse of today's Morocco. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Anfa; colonialism; decolonisation; Morocco; nationalism; Roosevelt; the Second World War","colonialism; decolonization; independence; international relations; nationalism; political discourse; political history; social movement; war; Casablanca [Morocco]; Morocco",,,13629387,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907428351

Selective alfa1 -adrenergic antagonists are now first-line drugs in the medical management of BPH. We conducted a single-blind, parallel group, randomized, controlled trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of the new alfa1 -blocker silodosin versus the established drug tamsulosin in symptomatic BPH. Materials and Methods: Ambulatory male BPH patients, aged above 50 years, were recruited on the basis of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either tamsulosin 0.4 mg controlled release or silodosin 8 mg once daily after dinner for 12-week. Primary outcome measure was reduction in IPSS. Proportion of subjects who achieved IPSS &lt;8, change in prostate size as assessed by ultrasonography and changes in peak urine flow rate and allied uroflowmetry parameters, were secondary effectiveness variables. Treatment emergent adverse events were recorded. Results: Data of 53 subjects - 26 on silodosin and 27 on tamsulosin were analyzed. Final IPSS at 12-week was significantly less than baseline for both groups. However, groups remained comparable in terms of IPSS at all visits. There was a significant impact on sexual function (assessed by IPSS sexual function score) in silodosin arm compared with tamsulosin. Prostate size and uroflowmetry parameters did not change. Both treatments were well-tolerated. Retrograde ejaculation was encountered only with silodosin and postural hypotension only with tamsulosin. Conclusions: Silodosin is comparable to tamsulosin in the treatment of BPH in Indian men. However, retrograde ejaculation may be troublesome for sexually active patients.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia; international prostate symptom score; randomized controlled trial; silodosin; tamsulosin","silodosin; tamsulosin; alpha 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; indole derivative; silodosin; sulfonamide; tamsulosin; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; Article; comparative study; controlled release formulation; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug screening; dyspepsia; echography; evening dosage; follow up; headache; human; International Prostate Symptom Score; lower urinary tract symptom; major clinical study; male; medical history; medication compliance; orthostatic hypotension; outcome assessment; outpatient care; outpatient department; prostate hypertrophy; prostate size; prostate volume; pruritus; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; retrograde ejaculation; risk assessment; sexual behavior; sexual function; single blind procedure; tertiary care center; treatment duration; uroflowmetry; world health organization; drug effects; middle aged; organ size; prostate; Prostatic Hyperplasia; treatment outcome; Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists; Aged; Humans; Indoles; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Prostate; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Single-Blind Method; Sulfonamides; Treatment Outcome",,,02537613,,INJPD,25538330,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916221456

Calculation of height velocity over time enables comparison with standardized growth charts to identify potential deviations from normal. Growth deviations may be expressed as SD from the normal population mean for children of comparable age and sex; children with heights >2 SD below the mean are generally classified as short stature. In a child with suspected impaired growth, a detailed evaluation should be conducted to identify the cause. Such an evaluation may include a combination of personal, family, and social history; physical examination; general and perhaps specialized laboratory evaluations; radiologic examinations; genetic testing; and consultation with a pediatric subspecialist, such as a pediatric endocrinologist. Variants of normal growth include familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and small for gestational age with catch-up growth. Pathological causes of abnormal growth include many systemic diseases and their treatments, growth hormone deficiency, and a series of genetic syndromes, including Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome. Children with short stature in whom no specific cause is identified may be diagnosed with idiopathic short stature.

The efforts of Ma Dexin (1794-1874) exemplify this shift to strengthen ties with the Muslim community outside China and situate Sino-Islamic scholarship in widespread Islamic discourses. Ma's writings provided Sino-Muslims with discursive and pragmatic tools for engaging a global Muslim community. For Ma, Muslim cooperation was negotiated through the means of religious education, which was enabled through travel and language. In this paper, I demonstrate how Ma Dexin modelled the importance of global connections of inter-Asian networks of religious learning by exemplifying the value ofMiddle Eastern travel and fluency in Arabic. I employ Ma's Chinese and Arabic written works in relation to those of Wang Daiyu(circa 1590-1658) and Liu Zhi(circa 1670-1724) to illustrate how he differed significantly from previous Sino-Muslim authors with regard to the use of Arabic within the Sino-Islamic intellectual tradition and in his emphatic urgings to perform the hajj pilgrimage.

We argue about the existence of a dialectical dualism of Celtic roots, and we remember that Celtic cultural and linguistic features are well attested in the region. Some kind of correspondence between the historical landscapes examined and the Celtic dualism is suggested. However, the relevance of the concept of «survival» is dismissed as both the local settlement pattern and the religion change at the beginning of the Middle Ages. Thus, although the identified dual structure finds their roots in the Iron Age, the observable social and religious reality belongs to the Christian peasants of later centuries.","Christianization; History of Galicia; Iron Age; Middle Ages; Rural World; Sacred Landscapes",,,,00347981,,,,"Spanish",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905910064

For much rests on the question of whether the post-war settlement was problematic due to its liberal nature or in spite of it. Yet, explanations as to why Versailles diplomacy was so problematic vary significantly. What were the central factors affecting policymaking at Versailles? And what does Paris Peace diplomacy tell IR theory about modern foreign policymaking processes? This article provides a critique of standard IR interpretations of Wilsonian diplomacy at Versailles, illustrating how realist and liberals' uncritical acceptance of Wilson as the quintessential 'idealist-liberal' statesman glosses over a core contradiction at the heart of Wilsonian diplomacy: the wielding of power politics to transcend power politics. In doing so, it examines the effects of the Bolshevik revolution as a paradigm-rupturing event transforming the nature and dynamics of the First World War and the post-war settlement. This traces the unique sociological patterns of uneven and combined development thrown up by the war and the geopolitical problems this created for Wilson and the Allies in forging a new international order. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","First World War; historical sociology; Marxism; Treaty of Versailles; uneven and combined development; Wilsonianism","diplomatic relations; dispute resolution; geopolitics; historical geography; Marxism; peace process; policy making; political history; post-war; power relations; theoretical study",,,13845748,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926611616

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses recent literature on why countries fail economically and qualitative analysis and statistical evidence where necessary to compare the two countries. Findings: During the first decade of independence, Fiji's economy grew at a rate of more than 5 per cent per annum. However, its economic prosperity was disrupted by the military coup in 1987. As a small island nation, Fiji's economic progress has been dismal and this can largely be attributed to the political instability created by the coups. Small island states like Mauritius has had uninterrupted growth rates in the same period and as a result has delivered significant improvement in the quality of life of its people. Research limitations/implications: Fiji could not become the Mauritius of the Pacific and points due to the lack of political stability and inclusive economic and political institutions. Social implications: Fiji could improve the quality of life of its people if it addresses the institutional constraint and it can learn from Mauritius.

Conceived within the liberal administration of Mayor La Guardia and dedicated to the principles of social cooperation, this ""closed-shop exposition"" granted American Federation of Labor (AFL) trade unions an unprecedented degree of workplace benefits and rhetorical support by the Fair administration. This was undermined, however, by the trade unions' limited public activities within the fair itself and their refusal of city offers to establish outreach and educational programs through events, rallies, and pavilions. As a result, the public space and discourse of a fair nominally devoted to social interdependence was appropriated by a variety of other interests, particularly those of corporate America. This marginalization would ultimately contribute to delegitimization, as allegations of graft and racketeering by visitors, exhibitors, and the national media framed labor as a direct threat to the ""World of Tomorrow"" and its visitors. Millions of Americans found their visits marred by exorbitantly inflated prices, delayed by strikes, and disappointed by cancelled exhibits. In the face of outside pressure, and with labor groups unable to address hostile critiques within the fair itself, the exposition administration withdrew its public support for unions while dramatically restricting their workplace rights. In this way, the ""business-union"" principles of the AFL not only undermined their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, despite the efforts of liberal municipal officials to promote them, but ultimately served to undo those very workplace gains such principles were meant to secure. © 2014 SAGE Publications.","labor; public space; public sphere; world's fair","administration; labor relations; marginalization; public space; trade union; urban economy; urban history; New York [United States]; United States",,,00961442,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84909967605

PPB involves getting farmers to participate in plant breeding to overcome shortcomings in the formal plant breeding system. The potato breeding system in the Netherlands has a long standing tradition of farmer participation in breeding. This PPB differs from the 'standard' PPB model as there is substantial private sector involvement and the system is situated in a modern, western context. Since its inception, farmer-breeders have contributed substantially to developing this potato breeding system, which supplies a large diversity of crop varieties that are grown in very varied environmental conditions around the world and for different consumer markets. This paper describes the current organizational structure and practices, provides some historical background and analyses the functions, relations and interactions of the major actors in the system. It argues that a historically international and commercially orientated potato sector was able to prosper because of a supportive political and legal context, which provided public institutional support to private sector potato breeding activities. Farmers' knowledge and skills are particularly well expressed and vital in breeding in potato-a very heterogeneous and vegetatively-propagated crop. A new PPB initiative called BioImpuls recently emerged and engages organic potato farmers in a search to develop late blight-resistant varieties for the organic sector. This supports the argument that farmers' knowledge can substantially contribute to modern and diversified breeding. While Dutch potato breeding is a special case in various respects, our analysis identifies several key attributes which could inform the design of successful PPB programmes in developing countries. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Farmer knowledge; Farmer-breeders; History; Institutionalization; Participatory plant breeding; Potato breeding; Solanum tuberosum","agriculture; developing world; environmental conditions; plant breeding; potato; private sector; reproductive strategy; smallholder; Netherlands; Solanum tuberosum",,,18764517,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907349398

In Catholic theology, this turn has encouraged new comparative and contextual theologies. Yet support for Christian mission and the world-Christian turn need not go together. Two cases in point: comparative theology tends to eschew mission while the work of Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI, is suspicious of some impulses behind the world-Christian turn and their potential for undermining Christian mission.

The region is credited with the use of unique agricultural systems, such as the Gavkari joint land management system. Agriculture has been practiced in the region from ancient times; the contacts it had with the Africans, Arabs, Turks, Romans, etc., enabled the trade of agricultural produce such as spices, textiles, perfumes, etc., much before the advent of Western European culture. The trading continued during the medieval period, and played an important role in the introduction and adaptation of several exotic crops into India, revolutionizing Indian agrobiodiversity. At the same time, it facilitated the dispersal of Indian crops such as rice, spices, coconut to other parts of the world, enriching global agrobiodiversity. Cultivation of enriched agrobiodiversity under diverse high-rainfall microclimatic conditions led to the development of unique tropical mixed cropping systems, generation and conservation of rich genetic diversity in most crops, and the creation of new avenues for farmers ' livelihood support. For these contributions, the region is being proposed as another National Agricultural Biodiversity Heritage Site in India, based on the indices illustrated for identification of an agricultural biodiversity heritage site.

In some ways this was a classic conspiracy theory with its vision of an omniscient organisation secretly controlling global events. Yet documents in the UK's National Archives reveal that during the Second World War, British agents did indeed provide covert support to Moroccan nationalism, including in particular the Party of Moroccan Unity under Mekki al-Naciri (1906–94). Furthermore, acting in concert with the US Office of Strategic Services, British intelligence prepared for a full-scale uprising in northern Morocco. Although British covert action was halted in 1944–45, its political ramifications, combined with pre-existing fears of British duplicity, explain much of Morocco's suspicion surrounding British intentions during the years leading up to Moroccan independence in 1956. The article concludes that while the belief in an external conspiracy was a paradigm in Moroccan history during the colonial period, on occasion the Great Powers and their agents did in fact plan covert actions in pursuit of their interest in controlling the North African littoral. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","colonialism; Great Britain; Morocco; nationalism; Second World War","colonialism; geopolitics; nationalism; organizational framework; party politics; political history; political power; war; England; Morocco; United Kingdom",,,13629387,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907914420

Pragmatic anthropology helps to counter that spiritual life-threat with a history of the human race that makes reason’s true end, which is practical and moral rather than speculative, newly self-transparent. It is neither theoretical nor empirical knowledge but instead specifically directed toward what is useful to human beings. Gaining such universal knowledge is no easy matter, and may require a world history or history of humanity, that has yet to be written. With such world history in mind, Kant turns, from empirical psychology to anthropology as such, which he describes as knowledge of the rules governing the phenomena of human beings, with a view to making use of them.

METHODS:: Retrospective multicenter study of 198 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for an idiopathic epiretinal membrane that was followed for at least 12 months. The diagnosis of sustained IOP elevation was defined as an elevation of IOP ≥ 24 mmHg or an increase of ≥ 5 mmHg in the IOP from baseline on 2 separate visits that warranted the initiation of ocular hypotensive therapy. The main outcome measured was the development of sustained IOP elevation as defined above. RESULTS:: Patients were followed for an average of 47.3 ± 24 months (range, 12-106 months). In the vitrectomized eyes, 38 of the 198 (19.2%) patients developed elevated IOP compared with 9 of the 198 (4.5%) unoperated fellow eyes (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact test; odds ratio, 4.988).

CONCLUSION:: Uncomplicated PPV seems to increase the IOP, particularly in those who are pseudophakic and have a family history of open-angle glaucoma. This increase in IOP may lead to glaucomatous damage if not managed appropriately. Patients with a previous PPV need to be followed by an ophthalmologist to monitor the IOP in the vitrectomized eye.

We investigated similarities and differences in the collective memories of younger and older adults for three major wars in U.S. history (the Civil War, World War II, and the Iraq War). Both groups were alive during the recent Iraq War, but only the older subjects were alive during World War II, and both groups learned about the Civil War from historical sources. Subjects recalled the 10 most important events that occurred during each war and then evaluated the emotional valence, the relative importance, and their level of knowledge for each event. They also estimated the percentage of people that would share their memory of each event within their age group and the other age group. Although most historical events were recalled by fewer than 25 % of subjects, younger and older adults commonly recalled a core set of events for each war that conform to a narrative structure that may be fundamental to collective remembering. Younger adults showed greater consensus in the events that they recalled for all three wars, relative to older adults, but there was less consensus in both groups for the Iraq War. Whereas younger adults recalled more specific events of short duration, older adults recalled more extended and summarized events of long duration.

The analysis documents the apparent persistence of prejudices against the Jewish minority among the Czechoslovak non-Jewish authorities that eventually formed the government-inexile (1940-5), under the presidency of Edvard Beneš (1884-1948). The Czechoslovak exiles believed that the Jewish minority, in particular the Jewish nationalists (Zionists), had vehement supporters within Jewish circles in Western countries. Furthermore, they believed that the Jewish press played a significant role in the formation of public opinion in Britain and especially in the United States. In the early 1940s, the government-in-exile embarked on a policy of national homogenisation of post-war Czechoslovakia and was anxious to give concessions to the political representatives of the ethnic minority groups in exile, in particular the Germans, Hungarians and Jews. Yet the concerns about Jewish influence in liberal democracies granted several political concessions to the Jewish minority, in particular the appointment of a Zionist representative, Arnošt Frischer (1887-1954), to the exile parliament. This notwithstanding, by analysing the internal situation among the Czechoslovak Jewish groups in London, the article documents the internal weakness and disputes among the Jewish groups which gradually revealed the utter powerlessness of the Jewish exiles during their negotiations with the Czechoslovak authorities. The Jewish groups (the assimilationists, Orthodox and secular nationalists) were divided by mutual as well as internal disputes which were not concealed from outside observers and were utilised by the exile government. What emerges from the analysis is an impression of quarrelling groups that could not agree on any of the fundamental issues and whose only power was the ability to court the support of Western Jewish groups, which were perceived by the non-Jewish exiles as influential actors in US and British society. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Antisemitism; Arnošt Frischer; Assimilation; Czech Jewish history; Czechoslovakia; Edvard Beneš; Exile; Jewish nationalism; Orthodox; Power; Second world war; Zionism",,,,13501674,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903201656

Prevalence of GDM was higher for women who had a previous stillbirth (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.4), family history of type 2 diabetes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), and MUAC above 28. cm (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3), and lower for women with normal hemoglobin compared with anemia (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22-0.93). Conclusions: Prevalence of GDM is higher than expected in urban areas in Tanzania, indicating an increasing population who are at risk for delivery complications and type 2 diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Gestational diabetes; Prevalence; Tanzania","adult; anemia; arm circumference; article; blood sampling; body height; capillary blood; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; family history; female; gestational age; glucose tolerance test; human; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prevalence; risk factor; rural area; Tanzania; urban area; urban rural difference; young adult; Gestational diabetes; Prevalence; Tanzania; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Life Style; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Rural Population; Tanzania; Urban Population; World Health Organization",,,01688227,,DRCPE,24367971,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893701567

Within its ministry to soldiers in the field, the male apostolate, founded in 1910, could realize its goal to bring the popular Heart of Jesus cult closer to male Catholics. This required some modifications, since the cult had been practised mainly by women since the mid-nineteenth century. The war allowed a recoding of patterns of piety previously seen as feminine and in which stereotypes of gender and emotion take on an important role. This paper describes the cult's propaganda during the war, in which stereotypes connoting the feminine and which had formed a central component of Sacred Heart piety were replaced by stereotypes connoting the masculine. In this way greater acceptance by the male target group was achieved, even after the end of the war.","Christ as King Cult; Emotional history; First World War; Gender stereotypes; Male apostolate; Male pastoral care; Masculinization; Sacred Heart Cult; War ministry",,,,16613880,,,,"German",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921967013

Tetraethylpyrophosphate was synthesized in 1854 as the first OP cholinesterase inhibitor. During 1934-1944, Gerhard Schrader, a German chemist at I. G. Farben industries and his coworkers synthesized about 2,000 OP compounds, including parathion as a pesticide and tabun, sarin, and soman as chemical warfare nerve agents. Although the nerve agents had been produced in Germany, they were not applied during World War II (WWII). At the end of WWII, the chemistry of OP compounds developed rapidly. The main use of nerve agents has been reported during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988). The Iraqi army used tabun and sarin against the Iranian troops (Majnoon Island) and civilians in Halabjah. In the 1990s, OP nerve agents have gained prominence as weapons of mass destruction and chemical terrorism. The use of sarin in chemical terroristic attacks has been reported during 1994-1995 in Matsumoto and Tokyo subway lines, Japan. Today, a wide range of OPs with a variety of biological properties are available for agricultural and public health usages including insecticides, nematocides, acaricides, and fungicides. As a result of the widespread use of OPs, OP poisoning is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in developing countries. OP poisoning shows demographic, seasonal, and regional variations. However, the pattern of OP poisoning is different in developed and developing countries.

LBSNs generate large amount of user generated content (UGC), including both location histories and social relationships, and provide us with opportunities to enable location-aware recommendation. Existing methods focus either on recommendation efficiency at the expense of low quality or on recommendation quality at the cost of low efficiency. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a group-based personalized location recommendation system, which can provide users with most interested locations, based on their personal preferences and social connections. We adopt a two-step method to make a trade-off between recommendation efficiency and quality. We first construct a hierarchy for locations based on their categories and group users based on their locations and the hierarchy. Then for each user, we identify her most relevant group and use the users in the group to recommend interested locations for the user. We have implemented our method and compared with existing approaches. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method achieves good quality and high performance and outperforms existing approaches. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Efficiency; Location history; Location-based social networks; Mobile Internet; Real-world datasets; Recommendation efficiency; Social connection; Social relationships; User generated content (UGC); Social networking (online)","61272090 and 61373024, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China",,03029743,9783319111155,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958554081

It argues that in the Republican period Kemalists effectively appropriated the Ottoman past for use in their nationalist narrative, not only through using a 'theory of fatal decline' but also by simply defining positive cultural or political symbols from the years 1299 to 1923 as 'Turkish' rather than 'Ottoman'. This serves as a backdrop for the article's main argument, that the 1940s and 1950s saw a thorough Kemalist appropriation of the Ottoman past, celebrating the empire's golden age as secular, pro-western and Turkish. The 500th anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul in 1953 gave the Turkish government an opportunity to showcase this new interpretation of Ottoman history as well as to use the relatively new rhetoric of 'Ottoman tolerance' to claim for Turkey a place among its new allies in the democratic, anti-communist West. At the level of domestic politics, the Democratic Party sought to wrap its modernization policies in the mantle of a progressive, democratic Fatih Sultan Mehmet II, while the Republican People's Party condemned the Democrats for betraying Fatih's memory and the nation's honour by downplaying the Ottoman past in order to placate potential anti-communist allies in Greece and the Arab world. Ultimately, the article argues that it is impossible to understand contemporary Islamist and liberal uses of the Ottoman past without understanding the way the empire was incorporated into the dominant Turkish nationalist narrative between 1923 and 1953. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"Arab world; government; Islamism; modernization; Ottoman empire; party politics; perception; political history; symbolism; Greece; Turkey",,,00263206,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901715350

However, in recent decades some researchers have been making interesting and noteworthy advances in the history of prestressed concrete. Some of these advances are discussed here, along with new data from the study of early patents on prestressed structures, and these resources are looked at from a new historical perspective: the four ages of prestressed concrete structures.

As knowledge of Indigenous service in overseas wars grows, the more these narratives have begun to be disseminated through a range of public history sites and audiences. This article focuses on the representation of Aboriginal people in the First World War in postcolonial documentaries made for television. The major emphasis will be on six documentaries screened on public broadcasters that foreground Aboriginal voices in revealing forgotten war service. Television has the capacity to reach a mass audience and therefore occupies an important position in challenging the monolithic white Anzac legend. However, the role of television as a legitimate communicator of historical argument is contested by many historians. This article contends that historical documentary possesses some advantages over the traditional written canon especially as a medium for Aboriginal storytelling.

Both environmental factors and genetic aspects are believed to be crucial to the pathogenesis of IBD. The incidence and prevalence of IBD have recently been increasing throughout Asia, presumably secondary to environmental changes. This increasing trend in IBD epidemiology necessitates specific health care planning and education in Asia. To this end, we must gain a precise understanding of the distinctive clinical and therapeutic characteristics of Asian patients with IBD. The phenotypes of IBD reportedly differ considerably between Asians and Caucasians. Thus, use of the same management strategies for these different populations may not be appropriate. Moreover, investigation of the Asian-specific clinical aspects of IBD offers the possibility of identifying causative factors in the pathogenesis of IBD in this geographical area. Accordingly, this review summarizes current knowledge of the phenotypic manifestations and management practices of patients with IBD, with a special focus on a comparison of Eastern and Western perspectives. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, the presence and extent of associations between common mental disorders and subsequent adult onset of hypertension remain unclear. Further, there are few data available on how such associations vary by gender or over life course. Methods: Data from the World Mental Health Surveys (comprising 19 countries and 52,095 adults) were used. Survival analyses estimated associations between first onset of common mental disorders and subsequent onset of hypertension, with and without psychiatric comorbidity adjustment. Variations in the strength of associations by gender and by life course stage of onset of both the mental disorder and hypertension were investigated. Results: After psychiatric comorbidity adjustment, depression, panic disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, alcohol abuse and drug abuse were significantly associated with subsequent diagnosis of hypertension (with odds ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.6). Number of lifetime mental disorders was associated with subsequent hypertension in a dose-response fashion. For social phobia and alcohol abuse, associations with hypertension were stronger for males than females. For panic disorder, the association with hypertension was particularly apparent in earlier-onset hypertension. Conclusions: Depression, anxiety, impulsive eating disorders and substance use disorders were significantly associated with the subsequent diagnosis of hypertension. These data underscore the importance of early detection of mental disorders, and of physical health monitoring in people with these conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Common mental disorders; Hypertension; World mental health surveys","adult; age distribution; aged; agoraphobia; alcohol abuse; article; binge eating disorder; bipolar disorder; bulimia; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; disease association; drug abuse; dysthymia; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental disease; onset age; panic; patient monitoring; sex difference; social phobia; Common mental disorders; Hypertension; World Mental Health Surveys; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety Disorders; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Impulse Control Disorders; Male; Middle Aged; Mood Disorders; Multivariate Analysis; Substance-Related Disorders; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",,,01638343,,GHPSD,24342112,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895504919

Before the war, teachers and educational administrators did not promote the instruction of militant nationalism, but focused upon cultivating the hard-working and dutiful citize n; furthermore, the methods of teaching were traditional and thus emphasized rote learning and the authority of the instructor. Once the war began, however, this practice changed - particularly in the cities. Educational methods were brought into line with the demands of reformers who urged childcentred learning, and the subjects of study now included the war itself. Boys and girls studied war maps, went on excursions, discussed newspaper accounts of battles, celebrated heroes like Hindenburg, and participated in volunteer activities to help the war. Even the physical environment of the classroom changed, from an empty drabness to rooms festooned with maps, photographs of airplanes, zeppelins, submarines, and drawings of battle. © 2014 School of Humanities & Social Sciences.","Children; First World War; History of education; Imperial Germany; War pedagogy",,,,07292473,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893184016

Gorky Donetsk, Donetsk, Ukraine","Objectives: This study aims to investigate the relationship of hemoglobin level with diseaseactivity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients and methods: The hemoglobin level, the 66/68 joint count, the Disease Activity Score28 joints (DAS28), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the Visual Analog Scales (VAS), the Modified Sharp Score (MSS), and the disease duration in 89 patients with RA were used to analyze the possible relationship. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for anemia uses a hemoglobin threshold of &lt; 120 g/L for women and &lt; 130 g/L for men. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients, patients with a history of other inflammatory or no inflammatory arthritis, malignancies, chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases and other diseases in the stage of decompensation were excluded from the study. Results: Anemia was observed in 64% of the patients (1st group); the other group (2nd group) had normal levels of hemoglobin. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between hemoglobin level and swollen and tender joints' count, DAS28, HAQ score, VAS, MSS, and disease duration (p &lt; 0.001). DAS28, HAQ score, VAS, MSS, swollen and tender joints' count and disease duration were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher in 1st versus 2nd group.

The imaging and radiobiologic characteristics of these tumors make them good candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), a technique that has been in use for over three decades. Patient selection is critical for successful SRS: small- to moderate-sized tumors can be effectively treated with SRS if the patient does not have symptoms related to mass effect. Factors related to tumor control in meningioma SRS include histology, history of prior surgery, and volume. Tumor control rates after SRS is significantly lower for patients with WHO grade II or III meningiomas compared to patients with WHO grade I meningiomas. The risk of radiation-related complications is higher for patients with larger tumors and tumors located over the convexities or along the falx. Patients with small-volume non-operated skull base or tentorial WHO grade I meningiomas typically have the best outcomes after SRS. Radiosurgery of sporadic VS provides a high tumor control rate (92-95 %), with less than a 5 % risk of facial weakness. Hearing preservation progressively declines for 10 years or more after SRS, and the primary factors related to long-term preservation of useful hearing are tumor size and pre-SRS hearing class.

The aim of the High5s project is to achieve a measurable, significant and sustained reduction in the occurrence of five serious patient safety problems within five years, in five countries. One of these patient safety issues is medication reconciliation - the process of assuring medication accuracy at transitions of care. In Germany, eleven hospitals are currently implementing medication reconciliation. Medication reconciliation represents the systematic comparison of the current patient's medication list with the medication list in hospital. For this purpose, Lead Technical Agencies of each participating country translated and adapted the standard operating procedure. This standard operating procedure describes the implementation and the procedure of the medication reconciliation process in detail. This process is divided into three parts. First, the best possible medication history is recorded. Second, based on those records, the responsible physician subsequently prescribes the medication. In the third step, the best possible medication history is compared with the medication orders at admission. During this process, it is likely that some discrepancies will occur. Such discrepancies are discussed with the responsible physician and clarified. A comprehensive acquisition of the best possible medication history is thus particularly important. It will be part of medical records throughout the patients' hospital stay. Thus it will be used as an additional source for comparison and adjustment of patients' medication in order to facilitate optimal drug treatment during the entire hospital stay. The practical implementation of medication reconciliation requires extensive change of the current prescription sheets or prescription software. Thus, this provides a great challenge for many hospitals. Nevertheless, in the Netherlands it has been shown that it is possible to prevent 90 % of unintentional discrepancies with medication reconciliation. A German hospital recently showed a reduction of discrepancies by about 77 %. The use of medication reconciliation to improve clinical endpoints is currently subject of further studies. © 2014 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.",,"attitude to health; clinical practice; health care concepts; health education; human; interpersonal communication; medication compliance; medication therapy management; patient care; patient safety; prescription; public health; quality control; review; Electronic Prescribing; Germany; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Medical History Taking; Medication Errors; Medication Reconciliation; National Health Programs; Patient Safety; Software; World Health Organization",,,00405930,,THUMA,24867348,"English; German",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901642324

After analysis in two subgroups we found that the condition on solvents had a significant effect, P values were 0. 005 5 and <0.000 1 on suspected oases of allergic reactions. For the first subgroup analysis, we found using other eight injections at the same time as Kudiezi injection could be risk factors in suspected cases of allergic reactions. For the second subgroup analysis combining using mannitol or fructose could increase risks. Based on this current research, condition on admission as well as the concomitant use of some other drugs may be the risk factors in suspected cases of allergic reactions.

To improve this situation, an in-depth conceptual dissection is presented here. It is elucidated that, at its core, the origin of life has three aspects. The facts involved in the process are taken as the historical aspect, which is destined to be uncertain and often irrelevant to debate regarding details. The rules involved include two distinct aspects: chemical mechanisms operated in the whole process, while evolutionary mechanisms joined in only after the emergence of the first Darwinian entities - and then accounted for the subsequent buildup of complexity (this cannot be explained solely by natural selection). Basically, we can ask about the possibility of any assumed event in the origin of life: 'Is it evolutionarily plausible, chemically feasible, and historically likely?'

This syndrome is characterized by axial hypotonia, severe mental retardation, dysarthria, athetoid movements, spastic paraplegia, and a typical thyroid hormone profile. In most of the cases reported so far, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed delayed myelination of the central white matter and this finding greatly affects the diagnosis of the syndrome. Case report: We present a new case studied with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy and we reviewed all the articles published between 2004 and 2012 containing information on brain neuroimaging in this syndrome. An Italian boy, showing a classical phenotype of the syndrome, was diagnosed at 17. months of age. Genetic analysis revealed a new frameshift mutation of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene. His brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, performed at the age of 14. months, were normal. Discussion: Among the 33 cases reported in the literature, 3 cases had normal neuroimaging and in 7 of 14 cases, having a longitudinal follow-up, the initial finding of delayed myelination gradually improved. Our case and the review of the pertinent literature suggest that Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome should be suspected in males with the typical neurological and thyroid profile, even in cases with normal brain myelination. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.","Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome; Brain magnetic resonance imaging; Central hypotonia; Monocarboxylate transporter 8; SLC16A2 gene; Thyroid hormone","electrolyte; monocarboxylate transporter 8; vitamin D; monocarboxylate transporter; SLC16A2 protein, human; allan herndon dudley syndrome; Apgar score; article; birth weight; blood sampling; case report; child; convergent strabismus; DNA sequence; family history; frameshift mutation; genetic analysis; growth curve; head circumference; hospitalization; human; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; intrauterine growth retardation; liver function; male; myelination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; physical examination; pregnancy; preschool child; psychomotor retardation; quadriplegia; sitting; speech disorder; stop codon; thyroid disease; thyroid function; vitamin K deficiency; walking; world health organization; X linked mental retardation; brain; frameshift mutation; genetics; infant; Mental Retardation, X-Linked; muscle hypotonia; Muscular Atrophy; myelin sheath; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pathology; Brain; Frameshift Mutation; Humans; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Mental Retardation, X-Linked; Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters; Muscle Hypotonia; Muscular Atrophy; Myelin Sheath",,,03877604,,BDEVD,24268987,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904473773

They all depend on their environment: on technology and available markets, on prevailing attitudes, in short, on all institutions at hand. This means that the individual firm with the help of theory might be linked to the macro level and analysed as an expression of contemporary trends. This approach is exemplified by the study of AB Åtvidabergs förenade industrier during World War I. Developments in this company were part of broad industrial trends. Before the war, the company expanded on international markets; during the war, expansion on the stock exchange opened up for a shift in management in 1918; and in the deflationary crisis, in the early 1920s, the company went bankrupt. The war meant the loss of foreign markets and inflation that brought new institutions to be handled. As a member of the managerial elite, the founder of the Åtvidaberg company considered it his duty to work not only for his company, but also for Sweden. In the war he tried in various ways to influence politics. It turns out that the company's bankruptcy during the deflationary crisis had a background in an inability to account for inflation. Inflationary book profits spurred high dividends and heavy investments in 1918-19 - investments that could not be supported when the prices fell in the early 1920s. A recalculation of the accounts of the Åtvidaberg company using a method elaborated in the 1920s turns the book profit of 1918 into a loss. Thus, the lack of methods for accounting for inflation meant inflationary profits that in the war and the following years stimulated heavy investments not only in the Åtvidaberg company, but also in quite a number of Swedish companies. In professional circles it was stressed in the 1920s that this sharpened the deflationary crisis. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","accounting; financing; inflation; institutions; micro and macro; Sweden; World War I, deflationary crisis in the early 1920s","economic history; economic theory; financial crisis; inflation; investment; macroeconomics; microeconomics; stock market; war; Sweden",,,00076791,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890798150

This is particularly true of the numerous theoretical subjects and themes covered by Tooze of direct relevance to Marxist theories and understandings of Nazism. From his analysis of the relationship between Nazi economic policies and Hitler's geopolitical objectives to the relations between capital and state to the specificities of Nazism as a distinct ideological and cultural apparatus to the role of the Nazi regime in triggering the 1939 cataclysm-in all these ways, Tooze's work speaks to a number of core issues at the heart of Marxist debates on Nazism, fascism, and the causes of the Second World War.

The study area is situated on a glacial modelled high mountain environment ranging from 1250 to 2800m.a.s.l.Multidisciplinary approaches integrating archaeology and palaeoenvironment have been directed towards the unravelling of the long-term human-landscape relationships, which ultimately resulted in the MPCV cultural landscape. The development of high-resolution temporal and spatial studies could successfully correlate archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data. This study leads to the location of more than 400 archaeological structures, 55 of which were excavated, and the multiproxy study of 7 palaeoenvironmental sequences. The combination and analysis of all these data have permitted developing a history of human-environment interactions from the Mesolithic to the 20th century. In this paper, data gathered in the MPCV corresponding to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods are presented for the first time.During the Early Neolithic small groups are documented with a diversified economy in which grazing, hunting, fishing, gathering and an incipient cereal agriculture activities are well represented. These groups seem to follow highly mobile occupation patterns with continuous high mountain seasonal grazing exploitations that lasted one or two centuries. They appear to frequent diverse altitudinal belts in order to take advantage of different resources. A strong pastoral orientation is related to the exploitation of high mountain areas.During the Middle/late Neolithic human groups show a higher degree of sedentism. Hunting and gathering are still important activities although agriculture and animal husbandry increase in importance. During this period an augmentation in the pastoral pressure in the MPCV is also documented, linked to the first use of fires to create grazing areas. Symbolic landscape appropriation practices are also firstly documented during this period.During the Chalcolithic, human landscape use becomes intensive enough to cause permanent landscape changes. The upper parts of the MPCV are deforested by the action of fire while intensive agriculture takes place at the lower valleys.The evidence presented by the MPCV project demonstrates that it was during the Neolithic when this high mountain cultural landscape was firstly formed. This process is probably related to an increase in the population and progressive sedentism, which required a more intensive and organised use of resources and, eventually, the adoption of landscape management practices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeological evidence; cultural landscape; glacial environment; human settlement; hunter-gatherer; mountain region; Neolithic; paleoenvironment; social history; UNESCO; World Heritage Site; Andorra; Madriu Valley; Pyrenees; Animalia",,,10406182,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923262960

Identifying common patterns, or progression stages, in such event sequences is a challenging task because not every individual follows the same evolutionary pattern, stages may have very different lengths, and individuals may progress at different rates. In this paper, we develop a model-based method for discovering common progression stages in general event sequences. We develop a generative model in which each sequence belongs to a class, and sequences from a given class pass through a common set of stages, where each sequence evolves at its own rate. We then develop a scalable algorithm to infer classes of sequences, while also segmenting each sequence into a set of stages. We evaluate our method on event sequences, ranging from patients' medical histories to online news and navigational traces from the Web. The evaluation shows that our methodology can predict future events in a sequence, while also accurately inferring meaningful progression stages, and effectively grouping sequences based on common progression patterns. More generally, our methodology allows us to reason about how event sequences progress over time, by discovering patterns and categories of temporal evolution in large-scale datasets of events.

Although Gypsies apparently arrived in Mesopotamia around the tenth century, long before many Arab tribes and despite their cultural assimilation into the local culture, Gypsies were not assimilated into the local society, partly because the local society rejected them and partly because they did not want to assimilate. The difference in the attitude of the local society to the Gypsies lies in their perceived 'impurity' and their occupation, dancing and music, in which Gypsy women are employed. Iraqi Gypsies had long suffered from social as well as governmental discrimination: Iraqi citizenship was given to them only in 1979. Unexpectedly, it was the Iraqi dictatorship of Saddam Hussein which improved their status considerably, yet, at the same time, made them dependent on the regime.

This article concerns itself with the observations and impressions, based on their time in China, of two of the earliest of modern India's envoys to China, K.P.S. Menon and K.M. Panikkar. The 1940s were a watershed period in the history of both India and China, when both countries found themselves in the midst of momentous transitions. The two Indian envoys had a ringside seat from where they could closely observe and comment on the complex situation unfolding before them in China. As two articulate Indians who observed China at frst hand, the writings of Menon and Panikkar offer us a unique and empathetic portrayal of China, which they viewed as a fellow Asian country facing enormous challenges not dissimilar to those of India. They show us that the governments of both India and China in this period, despite their many other preoccupations, were deeply interested in developments in the other country and in their relations with each other. At the same time, these writings also reveal that the very circumstances of the emergence of independent India and the People's Republic of China, both with a distinct sense of their own civilisational greatness and sharing a common boundary, carried latent tensions.","Chongqing; Diplomacy; India-china relations; K.M.

Study Design: Descriptive cross sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was carried in the Radiotherpay &amp; Oncology Department, Bolan Medical Complex Hospital, Quetta, from March 2010 to February 2012. Patients and Methods: Forty two patients of different types of NHL diagnosed on lymph node biopsy presenting for the first time at Radiotherapy &amp; Oncology Department in collaboration with Haematology Section (Pathology Deptt:), Bolan Medical Complex Hospital, Quetta, were included. They were admitted in the ward and evaluated with history, physical examination and for staging investigations. Patients were then planned for chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine with prednisolon (CHOP) and with rituximab (R-CHOP). After the first cycle of chemotherapy they were monitored for expected neutropenia in the ward. The neutrophil counts were repeated on days 7 and 10 following chemotherapy. Neutropenia was graded as defined in the operational definition and all the data were entered on a designed data sheet. Results: Forty two patients of NHL were included in this study, of which 34 patients received CHOP, and 08 patients R-CHOP, from march, 2010 to February, 2012.

In this paper, we study modeling user profiles in semantic environment and building a personalized recommender system exclusively on Linked Open Data. First, we define two concepts related to user browsing history and propose a hybrid user profile model (Hay-UPM).

At this time, fundamental restructuring of the military medical service on the Western Front had two main effects: Surgical capability was moved forward as close to the front as possible and specialist stretcher bearers were trained to apply emergency first aid at the place of injury and to triage casualties appropriately. The specialist stretcher bearers were the equivalent of today's combat medical technicians. The reorganisation was undertaken in a rapid, improvised 'bottom-up' manner and there are very few official records to detail the process. McKerrow and RMOs of his calibre were integral to the successful implementation and operation of this reorganisation so their personal archives are the primary sources for its history.

The anthropological study of money and ethnographies of finance, in particular, have been the focus of much research since the 1980s. Despite taking on new objects and directions, anthropologists still find it difficult to connect their situated analyses with global processes and world history.

Korean medicine, an integrated allopathic and traditional medicine, has developed unique characteristics and has been active in contributing to evidence-based medicine. Recent developments in Korean medicine have not been as well disseminated as traditional Chinese medicine. This introduction to recent developments in Korean medicine will draw attention to, and facilitate, the advancement of evidence-based complementary alternative medicine (CAM). Methods and Results. The history of and recent developments in Korean medicine as evidence-based medicine are explored through discussions on the development of a national standard classification of diseases and study reports, ranging from basic research to newly developed clinical therapies. A national standard classification of diseases has been developed and revised serially into an integrated classification of Western allopathic and traditional holistic medicine disease entities. Standard disease classifications offer a starting point for the reliable gathering of evidence and provide a representative example of the unique status of evidence-based Korean medicine as an integration of Western allopathic medicine and traditional holistic medicine. Conclusions. Recent developments in evidence-based Korean medicine show a unique development in evidence-based medicine, adopting both Western allopathic and holistic traditional medicine.

In untreated patients prognosis is poor. It depends on WHO-functional class. A delay from onset of symptoms and diagnosis can lead to a further worsening of prognosis. A pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice. We aimed to evaluate the time delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis and the WHO-functional class at primary diagnosis in patients with CTEPH. Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis of data from 70 monocentrically registered patients (48 women, 22 men, mean age 66,2 years ± 13,8 years) with confirmed CTEPH from the pulmonary hypertension expert center Missionsärztliche Klinik. Diagnostic work-up was performed according to the current guidelines. Results: Mean delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of CTEPH was 18 ± 26 months. Time delay was only slightly shorter in patients with a history of PE (n = 56; 81 %) than in patients without a history of PE (n = 13; 19 %): 16,9 ± 23,8 vs. 23,5Â ± 36,9 months. Time delay was higher in patients who received vasoactive medication before the first contact with a PH expert center and in patients who were classified as technically not suitable for a thrombendarterectomy. 38 patients with a history of acute PE did not have a period without symptoms. In 18 patients symptoms had transiently gone after PE. More than 70 % presented in WHO functional class III or IV. Conclusion: Time delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of CTEPH and referral to a PH expert center is long and the majority of patients presented in WHO-functional class III or IV. Prognosis is poor in untreated patients and getting worse with a higher WHO-functional class. For this reason, and because CTEPH can be cured by a pulmonary endarterectomy, each patient with suspected PH should be referred to a PH expert center to exclude CTEPH. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG • Stuttgart • New York.","chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary embolism; pulmonary hypertension; time-delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis; WHO-functional class","vasoactive agent; aged; article; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; delayed diagnosis; endarterectomy; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; practice guideline; pulmonary hypertension; retrospective study; symptom; world health organization; Aged; Algorithms; Chronic Disease; Cooperative Behavior; Delayed Diagnosis; Embolectomy; Endarterectomy; Female; Germany; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Interdisciplinary Communication; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Embolism; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Thrombectomy",,,00120472,,DMWOA,25093951,"German",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905675460

Methods: The means made available by National Health Competent Authorities (NCAs) for patients to report drug side effects were compared through literature review and questionnaire. Results: Among the 50 countries included in this study, we found that direct patient reporting systems exist in 44 countries and represent 9 % of total reports, the rest coming from healthcare professionals. Australia was the first, in 1964, and the United States has the system in which patients are the most involved. A total of 27 countries have a patient-specific reporting form, and 31 countries provide a form to complete online. In order to help patients, four countries constrain the description of the reaction and 12 constrain the choice of drug on the reporting form. Most of the surveyed countries request the patient's medical history (30 countries) and concomitant therapies (41 countries). The total number of fields per form ranges from 6 to 59, with a mean of 36 items. Conclusions: Most of the surveyed countries have implemented a patient adverse drug reaction reporting system. From this study, it seems that an online reporting form increases the rate of reporting. Currently, many different forms exist worldwide; these should be harmonized by considering the strengths and weaknesses of all existing forms. But above all, to increase the number of reports, each country should promote NCA-initiated adverse drug reactions reporting systems. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,"article; developing country; drug legislation; drug safety; drug surveillance program; health care personnel; human; medical history; patient education; patient participation; priority journal; questionnaire; world health organization; drug surveillance program; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; statistics and numerical data; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Health Personnel; Humans",,,01145916,,DRSAE,24748428,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901921309

This thesis is examined through the case study of a research sojourn at the German POW camp of Wilnsdorf, where Vienna anthropologist Rudolf Pöch and his collaborators were invited to pursue the kind of measurements and documentation which Pöch had initiated during the war in Austrian POW camps. While Pöch's original research proposals and project plans for POW camps still had claimed to investigate some of the major, overarching problems of anthropology and ethnography, the researchers soon lost sight of those theoretical questions when their investigation produced such a wealth of data that processing them did completely absorb them. The technical aspect of growing specialization in data processing, however, went hand in hand with a gradual shift of methodological interest. By consequence, the ensuing new thrust upon methodological autonomy for physical anthropology facilitated a theoretical re-orientation for both fields as well. After the war, and after Pöch's early death, this eventually led by the late 1920's to the establishment of separate university departments for physical anthropology and for Völkerkunde. Each of these two fields now followed theoretical premises that were difficult to reconcile, and that had little in common with the unified field of anthropology and ethnography that had existed in the pre-war years.","Anthropometrical measurements; First World War; History of anthropology; Methodology; Physical anthropology; POW camps",,,,02579774,,,,"German",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939803338

Methods We conducted a postmarketing analysis and systematically reviewed the published literature, grey literature, manufacturer's database, Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System, and the World Health Organization Individual Safety Case Reports Database (VigiBase). Eligible cases described a documented (or perceived) arrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron administration. The primary outcome was arrhythmia occurrence temporally associated with the administration of a single, oral ondansetron dose. Secondary objectives included identifying all cases associating ondansetron administration (any dose, frequency, or route) to an arrhythmia. Results Primary: No reports describing an arrhythmia associated with single oral ondansetron dose administration were identified. Secondary: Sixty unique reports were identified. Route of administration was predominantly intravenous (80%). A significant medical history (67%) or concomitant use of a QT-prolonging medication (67%) was identified in 83% of reports. Approximately one third occurred in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents, many of which are known to prolong the QT interval. An additional third involved administration to prevent postoperative vomiting. Conclusion Current evidence does not support routine ECG and electrolyte screening before single oral ondansetron dose administration to individuals without known risk factors.

Though the relations between these options are complex, they combine to produce a rich remedial array for those struggling with childlessness, the possibility that any impediment to procreation can be removed.

Design and setting: Examination of synopses all of the operas listed in a recent monograph covering a selection of operas written in the period 1607-2006. Main outcome measures: Frequency of completed suicides, non-fatal suicidal acts and suicidal thoughts over the entire 400-year period and in separate 100- year periods (1607-1706, 1707-1806, 1807-1906 and 1907-2006); circumstances of suicides; sex of the suicidal characters; and, for completed suicide, the method. Results: There were 337 operas in total. In 112 (33%), there was completed suicide alone, non-fatal suicidal acts or suicidal thoughts alone, or both. There was at least one suicide in 74 operas (22%); female characters accounted for 56% of these. Non-fatal suicidal acts or suicidal thoughts were found in 48 operas (14%); male characters accounted for 57% of these. Suicide, non-fatal acts and suicidal thoughts always followed an undesirable event or situation. Cutting or stabbing was the most common method of suicide (26 cases). Other methods included poisoning (15 cases), drowning (10 cases), hanging (four cases), asphyxiation (four cases), ""supernatural"" methods (four cases), immolation (three cases), jumping from a height (two cases), shooting (one) and blunt trauma (one).

Data analyzed in the article is based on the protected areas listed in the IUCN database. According to that most of the designations (779) were in Ukraine between 1971 and 1975. In the present five analyzed years (1971-1975) the growth of the designations stopped, there were less areas designated than in the previous five year period. In the analyzed period of 1971 and 1975 220 national categories existed. Among the size of the areas the 0-99 ha areas outnumbered all other (almost half of the designated areas belong to this size), however only 0,015% of all established protected area belongs here from the spatial distribution point of view. 14 Hungarian protected areas appear in the IUCN database in this period. An important action took place in this period, the establishment of the first Hungarian national park on the Hortobágy area in 1973. Two areas have extreme sizes in this period. One of them is the North East Greenland National Park with 97.2 million hectare. The other area is the Great Barrier Reef Marie Park in Australia with its 34.4 million hectare area.

It is extensively utilized by most of modern search engines to improve ranking by constructing certain ranking features as well as by personalizing search. Personalization aims at two major goals: extraction of stable preferences of a user and specification and disambiguation of the current query. The common way to approach these problems is to extract information from user's search and browsing long-term history and to utilize short-term history to determine the context of a given query. Personalization of the web search for the first queries in new search sessions of new users is more difficult due to the lack of both long- and short-term data. In this paper we study the problem of short-term personalization. To be more precise, we restrict our attention to the set of initial queries of search sessions. These, with the lack of contextual information, are known to be the most challenging for short-term personalization and are not covered by previous studies on the subject. To approach this problem in the absence of the search context, we employ short-term browsing context. We apply a widespread framework for personalization of search results based on the re-ranking approach and evaluate our methods on the large scale data. The proposed methods are shown to significantly improve non-personalized ranking of one of the major commercial search engines. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study addressing the problem of short-term personalization based on recent browsing history. We find that performance of this re-ranking approach can be reasonably predicted given a query. When we restrict the use of our method to the queries with largest expected gain, the resulting benefit of personalization increases significantly.

Routine administrative reporting systems were established and showed that national coverage rates for DTP-3 rose from 20% in 2002 to 80% in 2011. This survey was conducted as part of an overall review of progress in implementation of the first EPI Multi-Year Plan for South Sudan 2007-2011. This report provides maiden community coverage estimates for immunization. Methods: A cross sectional community survey was conducted between January and May 2012. Ten cluster surveys were conducted to generate state-specific coverage estimates. The WHO 30x7 cluster sampling method was employed. Data was collected using pre-tested, interviewer guided, structured questionnaires through house to house visits. Results: The fully immunized children were 7.3%. Coverage for specific antigens were; BCG (28.3%), DTP-1(25.9%), DTP-3 (22.0%), Measles (16.8%). The drop-out rate between the first and third doses of DTP was 21.3%. Immunization coverage estimates based on card and history were higher, at 45.7% for DTP-3, 45.8% for MCV and 32.2 for full immunization. Majority of immunizations (80.8%) were received at health facilities compared to community service points (19.2%). The major reason for missed immunizations was inadequate information (41.1%). Conclusion: The proportion of card-verified, fully vaccinated among children aged 12-23 months is very low at 7.3%. Future efforts to improve vaccination quality and coverage should prioritize training of vaccinators and program communication to levels equivalent or higher than investments in EPI cold chain systems since 2007. © William Mbabazi et al.","Immunization Coverage survey; South Sudan","BCG vaccine; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; measles vaccine; Meningococcus vaccine; oral poliomyelitis vaccine; vaccine; child; community; cross-sectional study; health care facility; health survey; human; immunization; medical history; preschool child; questionnaire; review; sampling; social welfare; Sudan; world health organization; cluster analysis; immunization; infant; interpersonal communication; patient education; preventive health service; procedures; standards; statistics and numerical data; Cluster Analysis; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Immunization; Immunization Programs; Infant; Patient Education as Topic; Questionnaires; Sudan; Vaccines",,,19378688,,,24876899,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888625240

In 1959, J.Lejeune, M.Gautier, and R.Turpin demonstrated that the children with Down syndrome had an extra copy of chromosome 21. There is now a debate within the medical literature on the age of trisomy 21 as a disease affecting mankind. Since it was not described before 1866, some authors questioned whether this disease is an old or new condition in humans. Three methods of investigation are useful for demonstrating that trisomy 21 has been present in humans for a long time: the figuration of this condition in historical paintings, figurines, and pottery; its presence in old skeletal remains; and the origin of human chromosome 21 during primate phylogeny. Figurines strongly suggestive of trisomy 21 have been found in the Greco-Roman world, in many Central and South American pre-Columbian cultures, and in Khmer temples. In Europe, during the Renaissance, Italian and Flemish artists represented trisomy 21 in paintings of religious inspiration. Studies on the origin and pathology of chromosome 21 have shown that the ancestral human chromosome 21 arose 30-50 million years ago and that trisomy 21 has existed since time immemorial. © 2013.",,"chromosome 21; cultural factor; Down syndrome; human; nonhuman; phylogeny; primate; short survey; trisomy 21; archeology; art; article; Cambodia; Central America; cultural anthropology; Down syndrome; Europe; history; painting; South America; Archaeology; Cambodia; Central America; Down Syndrome; Europe; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Medicine in Art; Paintings; Roman World; Sculpture; South America",,,0929693X,,APEDE,24210986,"French; English",Short Survey,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888042186

The personal experiences of the author are obviously only reflected over these 40 years so that the glorious antecedents in the period up to 1933, the era in which our predecessors were the world leaders in neurology, is not sufficiently covered. This dominance was lost by the anti-Semitism during the era of National Socialism and the sequelae of World War II. As a result of the war, German neurologists became effectively isolated and their participation in international congresses was forbidden so that a gradual reestablishment of alignment only became possible after 1960. In this brief description no attempt at completeness has been made and only subjectivity and brevity have been considered. An attempt is made to retrospectively convey what essentially happened. An exact dating of advances over the period was sometimes difficult. The readership will have the opportunity to share the surprise of the author on how meagre the neurological knowledge and diagnostic methods were 50 years ago, how rapidly the subsequent development happened, how rapidly things became obvious which 20 years ago nobody was aware of and despite the progress how pleased we were to find ourselves at the most recent state of error and probably still find ourselves nowadays. In particular, how powerless and untested the therapeutic efforts were at that time. The progress can only be measured by a comparison between then, 50 years ago and the present. A projection of the future based on these experiences is not attempted but it seems to be certain that many conceptions, diagnostic advances and therapy options are still undiscovered and that further exciting times can be expected. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Diagnostic methods; History; Neurology; Structure; Therapy","article; Germany; human; neurologist; neurology; political system; art; forecasting; history; neurology; trends; war; Forecasting; Germany; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; National Socialism; Neurology; World War II",,,00282804,,NERVA,24253482,"German",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892827692

Orsola Hospital, Bologna, Italy; Department of Internal Medicine, Budrio General Hospital, Budrio, Italy","After the fall of the Fascist regime on September 8, 1943, Italy was split into two parts: (i) the Southern regions where the King Victor Emanuel III and the military general staff escaped was under the control of English-American allied armies, and (ii) the northern regions comprising Lazio, Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche still under the control of the Germans. The German Wehrmacht, after suffering several defeats on Southern lines, established a new strengthened line of defence called the Gustav line, located south of Rome and crossing in the western portion the recently-drained Pontine Marshes. In his book published in 2006, Frank Snowden hypothesised that occupying German armies in 1943 had initiated a programme of re-flooding the Pontine plain as a biological warfare strategy to re-introduce malaria infection in the territories south of Rome, Such a plan was intended (i) to slow down the advance of English-American forces, and (ii) to punish Italians who abandoned their former allies. Other authors, including Annibale Folchi, Erhard Geissler, and Jeanne Guillemin, have disputed this hypothesis based on an analysis of recently-uncovered archive documents. What is not disputed is that the flooding of the Pontine and Roman plains in 1943 contributed to a severe malaria epidemic in 1944, which was associated with exceptionally high morbidity and mortality rates in the afflicted populations. Herein, we critically evaluate the evidence and arguments of whether the Wehrmacht specifically aimed to spread malaria as a novel biological warfare strategy in Italy during the Second World War. In our opinion, evidence for specific orders to deliberately spread malaria by the German army is lacking, although the strategy itself may have been considered by Nazis during the waning years of the war.","Anopheles labranchiae; Biological warfare; Environmental changes; Malaria; World war two","article; battle injury; biological warfare; human; infection control; infection risk; Italy; malaria; military medicine; morbidity; mortality; prisoner of war; war; art; biological warfare; history; malaria; war; wetland; Biological Warfare; History, 20th Century; Italy; Malaria; Wetlands; World War II",,,11249390,,INMEF,24335465,"English; Italian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891620601

Hiroshi Kawahara and Kinnosuke Miura, pioneers of Japan Neurology, received their education by him. Kawahara first described X-linked bulvo-spinal muscular atrophy, and published the first Japanese textbook of clinical neurology in 1897. In 1902, Miura and others founded the Japanese Society of Neuro-Psychiatry, the forerunner of the present "" Japanese Society of Neurology "". Both Seizo Katsunuma, Professor of Nagoya University, and Junnjiro Kato, Professor of Tohoku University, succeeded Miura's neurology. Miura investigated into the cause of beriberi, but ended in failure. Hasegawa's proposal at the Diet in 1894 that the Japan Government should found an independent department of neurology in the University of Tokyo was unfortunately rejected. There was no foundation of independent institute, department and clinic of neurology before World War II.

Results: The shocking exposition of suicides reveals the zeitgeist of each era and illustrates the prevailing concepts. Social and legal reactions appear ambivalent, as they can oscillate from acceptance and interpretation of the act to punishment. In the history of these attitudes, we can observe continuities and breaches, reserving a special place in cases of mental disease. The delayed emergence of a generally accepted term for the voluntary exit from life (the term suicidium established during the 17th century), is connected to reactions triggered by the act of suicide than to the frequency and the extent of the phenomenon.

Box 85500, Utrecht GA 3508, The Netherlands.","Is there an association between acute prenatal famine exposure or birthweight and subsequent reproductive performance and age at menopause? No association was found between intrauterine famine exposure and reproductive performance, but survival analysis showed that women exposed in utero were 24% more likely to experience menopause at any age. Associations between prenatal famine and subsequent reproductive performance have been examined previously with inconsistent results. Evidence for the effects of famine exposure on age at natural menopause is limited to one study of post-natal exposure. This cohort study included men and women born around the time of the Dutch famine of 1944-1945. The study participants (n = 1070) underwent standardized interviews on reproductive parameters at a mean age of 59 years. The participants were grouped as men and women with prenatal famine exposure (n = 407), their same-sex siblings (family controls, n = 319) or other men and women born before or after the famine period (time controls, n = 344). Associations of famine exposure with reproductive performance and menopause were analysed using logistic regression and survival analysis with competing risk, after controlling for family clustering. Gestational famine exposure was not associated with nulliparity, age at birth of first child, difficulties conceiving or pregnancy outcome (all P> 0.05) in men or women. At any given age, women were more likely to experience menopause after gestational exposure to famine (hazard ratio 1.24; 95% CI 1.03, 1.51). The association was not attenuated with an additional control for a woman's birthweight. In this study, there was no association between birthweight and age at menopause after adjustment for gestational famine exposure. Age at menopause was self-reported and assessed retrospectively. The study power to examine associations with specific gestational periods of famine exposure and reproductive function was limited. Our findings support previous results that prenatal famine exposure is not related to reproductive performance in adult life. However, natural menopause occurs earlier after prenatal famine exposure, suggesting that early life events can affect organ function even at the ovarian level.

Systematic morbidity estimates for the burden of impairment outcomes are currently limited. Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) following an intrapartum hypoxic event is a strong predictor of long-term impairment. Methods: Linear regression modeling was conducted on data identified through systematic reviews to estimate NE incidence and time trends for 184 countries. Meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the risk of NE by sex of the newborn, neonatal case fatality rate, and impairment risk. A compartmental model estimated postneonatal survivors of NE, depending on access to care, and then the proportion of survivors with impairment. Separate modeling for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 (GBD2010) study estimated disability adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) attributed to intrapartum-related events. Results: In 2010, 1.15 million babies (uncertainty range: 0.89-1.60 million; 8.5 cases per 1,000 live births) were estimated to have developed NE associated with intrapartum events, with 96% born in low- and middle-income countries, as compared with 1.60 million in 1990 (11.7 cases per 1,000 live births). An estimated 287,000 (181,000-440,000) neonates with NE died in 2010; 233,000 (163,000-342,000) survived with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment; and 181,000 (82,000-319,000) had mild impairment. In GBD2010, intrapartum-related conditions comprised 50.2 million DALYs (2.4% of total) and 6.1 million YLDs. Conclusion: Intrapartum-related conditions are a large global burden, mostly due to high mortality in low-income countries. Universal coverage of obstetric care and neonatal resuscitation would prevent most of these deaths and disabilities. Rates of impairment are highest in middle-income countries where neonatal intensive care was more recently introduced, but quality may be poor. In settings without neonatal intensive care, the impairment rate is low due to high mortality, which is relevant for the scale-up of basic neonatal resuscitation.

Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the risk of ROP and subsequent visual impairment for surviving preterm babies by level of neonatal care, access to ROP screening, and treatment. A compartmental model was used to estimate ROP cases and numbers of visually impaired survivors. Results: In 2010, an estimated 184,700 (uncertainty range: 169,600-214,500) preterm babies developed any stage of ROP, 20,000 (15,500-27,200) of whom became blind or severely visually impaired from ROP, and a further 12,300 (8,300-18,400) developed mild/moderate visual impairment. Sixty-five percent of those visually impaired from ROP were born in middle-income regions; 6.2% (4.3-8.9%) of all ROP visually impaired infants were born at >32-wk gestation. Visual impairment from other conditions associated with preterm birth will affect larger numbers of survivors. Conclusion: Improved care, including oxygen delivery and monitoring, for preterm babies in all facility settings would reduce the number of babies affected with ROP.

We applied a compartmental model to estimate neonatal survivors and impairment cases for 2010. Results: Twenty-four million (18% of 134 million live births ≥32 wk gestational age from 184 countries; uncertainty range: 23-26 million) were at risk for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia-related adverse outcomes.

Only French and English were used as the official languages of the new scientific organizations, just as in the League of Nations. The boycott was based on the fact that the German scientists had denied German war guilt and war crimes and glorified German militarism in a manifesto To The Civilized World! in 1914. The boycott first started in 1919 and had to be abolished in 1926, when Germany became a member of the League of Nations. Many German and foreign physicians as well as other scientists protested against the boycott. Some German scientists and institutions even staged a counter-boycott impeding the resumption of international collaboration. The boycott entailed an enduring decline of German as an international scientific language. After the Second World War scientists of the victorious Western Powers implemented a complete reorganization of the international scientific arena, based on the same organizational structures and language restrictions they had built up in 1919/1920. At the same time scientists from the U.S.A. staged an active language and publication policy, in order to establish the dominance of English in the international scientific arena.",,"article; Germany; human; language; scientist; war; Dissent and Disputes; Germany; History, 20th Century; International Cooperation; Interprofessional Relations; Language; Prejudice; Science; Social Control Policies; World War I",,,00120472,,DMWOA,24343188,"German",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890483927

It shows that it is a powerful tool to explain how the basic form of the comic, articulating a diegetic sequence with coexisting panels, can build reference to different worlds and give the reader access to worlds that are symbolically, logically or ontologically different from the actual world. Joining together different fictional worlds, intertwining many narratives, and actualizing a passage of the superhero from fiction to reality, Watchmen is at the same time an alternative history, a parody and a metafiction. Far from being a cerebral experience, the intense circulation between worlds builds immersion in fiction and, in the case of this particular comic book, leads pragmatically to a critique of the superhero figure and the political order it is attached to. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Alternative history; Graphic narratives; Literary theory of possible worlds; Superhero; Transfictionality; Utopia/dystopia; Watchmen",,,,03244652,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888301586

The recent years have witnessed an increasing number of novel infectious diseases. The numerous examples of infections which originated from animals suggest that the zoonotic pool is an important and potentially rich source of emerging diseases. Since emergence and re-emergence of pathogens, and particularly zoonotic agents, occur at unpredictable rates in animal and human populations, infectious diseases will constitute a significant challenge for the public health and animal health communities in the twenty-first century. The African continent suffers from one of the highest burdens of infectious diseases of humans and animals in the world but has the least capacity for their detection, identification and monitoring. Lessons learnt from recent zoonotic epidemics in Africa and elsewhere clearly indicate the need for coordinated research, interdisciplinary centres, response systems and infrastructures, integrated surveillance systems and workforce development strategies. More and stronger partnerships across national and international sectors (human health, animal health, environment) and disciplines (natural and social sciences) involving public, academic and private organisations and institutions will be required to meet the present and future challenges of infectious diseases. In order to strengthen the efficiency of early warning systems, monitoring trends and disease prediction and timely outbreak interventions for the benefit of the national and international community, it is essential that each nation improves its own capacity in disease recognition and laboratory competence. The SACIDS, a One Health African initiative linking southern African academic and research institutions in smart partnership with centres of science excellence in industrialised countries as well as international research centres, strives to strengthen Africa's capacity to detect, identify and monitor infectious diseases of humans and animals, to better manage health and socio-economic risks posed by them, and to improve research capacity in investigation the biologic, socio-economic, ecologic and anthropogenic factors responsible for emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"animal health; Arenavirus; article; Bacillus; biological model; case study; clinical protocol; community program; Congo; disease re-emergence; disease surveillance; epidemic; Filovirus; flea; food security; foot and mouth disease; health care facility; health care organization; health care system; health education; health program; human; livestock; medical history; medical research; microorganism; nonhuman; plague; policy; prediction; priority journal; program development; public health service; Rift Valley fever; rodent; socioeconomics; South Africa; Tanzania; virtual reality; virus characterization; wildlife; Zambia; zoonosis; Animals; Communicable Disease Control; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Cooperative Behavior; Disease Outbreaks; Food Supply; Humans; South Africa; World Health; Zoonoses","Wellcome Trust; Rockefeller Foundation",,0070217X,9783642358456,CTMIA,22820706,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893022517

In this period, the city has seen extremes of both prosperity and decline. It pioneered many of the elements of the modern industrial metropolis, only to deurbanise during a ruinous late 20th century decline, halving its population. The centre has now been successfully re-urbanised and the city population is growing, but spatial inequalities remain intense. As a focus for policy remedies from across the ideological spectrum, Liverpool offers an instructive archive of approaches of continued relevance and interest.Liverpool emerged as a modern global city, based around new systems of international trade and capital during the 18th and 19th centuries. Growth and wealth were manifested physically in grand architectural landscapes and the planned development of often pioneering modern urban infrastructure such as railways, parks, docklands and public housing. Liverpool was among the earliest places to face acute social challenges characteristic of the industrial city. Its universal importance is reflected in UNESCO World Heritage Site status for significant portions of its docklands and downtown area.The city's population peaked in the 1930s with much of the subsequent century witnessing an accelerating reversal of the city's fortunes, as a result of unfavourable economic restructuring, war damage and key planning decisions. Throughout the 20th century Liverpool has been an early test bed for urban policies, sometimes applied from opposing poles of the ideological spectrum. In the switch from planned growth to managing and reversing decline, there have been numerous efforts to 'regenerate' the city's economic, physical and social fabric, many have been successful, whilst others have been seen as deeply damaging, making Liverpool something of an 'urban laboratory' worthy of careful consideration and reflection.Informed by the historical trajectory outlined above, this Profile firstly discusses Liverpool's rise to prominence as a global trade centre in the 18th and 19th centuries. Secondly, challenges faced during the 20th century are considered. Finally, the recent history of redevelopment and regeneration is reviewed and followed by reflections on the present city and its future prospects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cultural heritage; Economic restructuring; Port-related urban development; Regeneration; Spatial planning; Urban governance; Urban shrinkage; World Heritage Site","capital flow; cultural heritage; economic structure; ideology; infrastructure; redevelopment; spatial planning; UNESCO; urban development; urban history; urban policy; urban renewal; World Heritage Site; England; Liverpool [England]; United Kingdom",,,02642751,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885290633

The clinical utility and analytical importance of recording chief complaints have been widely accepted in highly developed emergency care systems, but this practice is far from universal in global emergency care, especially in limited-resource areas. It is precisely in these settings, however, that the use of chief complaints may have particular benefit. Chief complaints may be used to quantify, analyze, and plan for emergency care and provide valuable information on acute care needs where there are crucial data gaps. Globally, much work has been done to establish local practices around chief complaint collection and use, but no standards have been established and little work has been done to identify minimum effective sets of chief complaints that may be used in limited-resource settings. As part of the Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference, ""Global Health and Emergency Care: A Research Agenda,"" the breakout group on data management identified the lack of research on emergency chief complaints globally - especially in low-income countries where the highest proportion of the world's population resides - as a major gap in global emergency care research.

We sought to determine the prevalence and factors associated with preoperative anemia in addition to the prognostic effects of the various levels of preoperative hemoglobin level on mortality in patients undergoing TAVI. Methods and Results-Ten-center observational study encompassing 1696 patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI was conducted. Anemia was defined by the World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin <12.0 g/dL in women and <13.0 g/dL in men). The prevalence of preoperative anemia was 57%. Patient-related factors associated with preoperative anemia were (descending order of odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) as follows: anemiarelated medication (4.90 [3.08-7.80]), history of heart failure (1.77 [1.43-2.20]), male sex (1.69 [1.32-2.16]), mitral regurgitation grade ≥III (1.61 [1.15-2.25]), history of malignancy (1.44 [1.03-2.09]), and peripheral vascular disease (1.33 [1.04-1.70]). The creatinine clearance was inversely associated with preoperative anemia (odds ratio, 0.92 [0.87-0.97]). In multivariable analyses, preoperative anemia was not associated with 30-day mortality (1.72 [0.96-3.12]; P=0.073) but showed the strongest association with 1-year mortality with a hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.78 (1.60-4.82) in patients with hemoglobin >10 g/dL. Patients with anemia received ≥1 blood transfusion 2× more often, but the indication of transfusion was unrelated to overt bleeding in 60%. Blood transfusion was associated with mortality at 30 days (odds ratio, 1.25 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.67]) and during follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.09 [95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.14]). Conclusions- Preoperative anemia is prevalent in >50% of patients undergoing TAVI. Various baseline factors were related to anemia, which in turn was associated with 1-year mortality. Patients with anemia received more transfusions but mostly for indications unrelated to overt bleeding, whereas transfusion was independently associated with both early and 1-year mortality. These findings indicate that optimization of baseline factors related to preoperative anemia, in addition to more strict criteria of the use of blood products, may improve outcome after TAVI. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.","Anemia; Blood transfusion; Hemoglobin","creatinine; erythropoietin; hemoglobin; aged; anemia; aorta stenosis; aorta valve prosthesis; article; blood transfusion; creatinine clearance; disease association; female; hazard ratio; heart failure; hemoglobin blood level; human; iron therapy; major clinical study; male; medical history; mitral valve regurgitation; mortality; multicenter study; neoplasm; observational study; percutaneous aortic valve; peripheral vascular disease; postoperative hemorrhage; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prognosis; sex difference; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; very elderly; world health organization; anemia; blood transfusion; hemoglobin; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anemia; Blood Transfusion; Cardiac Catheterization; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Heart Valves; Humans; Male; Preoperative Period; Prevalence; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Survival Rate; Time Factors",,,19417640,,,24280965,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892389512

Objective: To summarise and critically review the current literature on genotype-phenotype associations in patients with HCM and to perform a meta-analysis on selected clinical features. Data sources: PubMed/Medline was searched up to January 2013. Retrieved articles were checked for additional publications. Selection criteria: Observational, cross-sectional and prospectively designed English language human studies that analysed the relationship between the presence of mutations in sarcomeric protein genes and clinical parameters. Data extraction and analysis: The pooled analysis was confined to studies reporting on cohorts of unrelated and consecutive patients in which at least two sarcomere genes were sequenced. A random effect meta-regression model was used to determine the overall prevalence of predefined clinical features: age at presentation, gender, family history of HCM, family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and maximum left ventricular wall thickness (MLVWT). The I2 statistic was used to estimate the proportion of total variability in the prevalence data attributable to the heterogeneity between studies. Results: Eighteen publications (corresponding to a total of 2459 patients) were selected for the pooled analysis. The presence of any sarcomere gene mutation was associated with a younger age at presentation (38.4 vs 46.0 years, p&lt;0.0005), a family history of HCM (50.6% vs 23.1%, p&lt;0.0005), a family history of SCD (27.0% vs 14.9%, p&lt;0.0005) and greater MLVWT (21.0 vs 19.3 mm, p=0.03). There were no differences when the two most frequently affected genes, MYBPC3 and MYH7, were compared. A total of 53 family studies were also included in the review. These were characterised by pronounced variability and the majority of studies reporting on outcomes analysed small cross-sectional cohorts and were unsuitable for pooled analyses. Conclusions: The presence of a mutation in any sarcomere gene is associated with a number of clinical features. The heterogeneous nature of the disease and the inconsistency of study design precludes the establishment of more precise genotype-phenotype relationships. Large scale studies examining the relation between genotype, disease severity, and prognosis are required.",,"alcohol; arginine; biological marker; C terminal propeptide; gadolinium; muscle protein; sarcomeric protein; tryptophan; unclassified drug; abnormal blood pressure; abnormal blood pressure response to exercise; ACTC1 gene; age distribution; alcohol septal ablation; chronic disease; contrast enhancement; device therapy; disease severity; exercise; faintness; family history; gene; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic association; genotype phenotype correlation; heart atrium fibrillation; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart left ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart left ventricle size; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle fibrosis; heterozygosity; histopathology; homozygosity; human; hypertension; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; implantation; microvasculature; missense mutation; mitral valve regurgitation; muscle resection; mutational analysis; MYBPC3 gene; MYH7 gene; penetrance; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; review; risk factor; sarcomere gene; septal myectomy; sequence analysis; sex difference; sudden cardiac death; systematic review; TNNI3 gene; Tnnt2 gene; TPM1 gene; Genetics; Cardiac Myosins; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; DNA; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Mutation; Phenotype; Prevalence; Troponin; World Health",,,13556037,,HEARF,23674365,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888066429

Despite overwhelming experimental and epidemiological evidence, some still debate the relation between salt and hypertension. Pointing to some conflicting data in a few flawed studies, they argue that policy interventions to reduce the dietary intake of salt are premature and maybe unsafe without further studies. A brief review of data relating salt intake to hypertension, along with an overview of the history of the introduction of salt to human diet on an historic and evolutionary time scale, should help dispel doubts on the effectiveness and safety of low-salt diet. The recorded history confirms how rare and inaccessible salt has been until recent times. Like all other terrestrial life forms, humans evolved in a salt-free environment under intense evolutionary pressure for the selection of salt-conserving genes. Hypertension is a prototypical evolutionary maladaptation disorder of the modern man - a species exquisitely well adapted to low salt conditions suddenly confronted with salt excess. The World Health Organization and many governments have finally taken action to reduce dietary intake of salt, which already has started to reduce the burden of hypertension and the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This brief review is to broadly look at the evidence linking salt to hypertension from a historic and evolutionary perspective as well as touching upon some of the epidemiological and experimental data. © 2013 International Society of Nephrology.","Cardiovascular morbidity; evolutionary mismatch; hypertension; salt; selection pressure","sodium chloride; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; conference paper; disease association; evolution; government; history; human; hypertension; maladjustment; morbidity; salt intake; sodium restriction; world health organization",,,21571724,,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896710822

The two churches were carved into volcanic scoria deposits of basaltic composition. In their geological history, the Lalibela volcanic rocks underwent late to post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration together with partial laterization and are therefore characterized by a decay-prone highly vesicular microtexture with late stage to post-magmatic precipitation of secondary mineral phases (calcite-zeolite-smectite). The main objective of the study was to gain a better insight into the weathering products and mechanisms affecting the surface of the stone monuments and to assess the relative contribution of natural ""geological"" weathering processes versus biological/salt attack in stone decay at this unique heritage site. Results indicate that while the main cause of bulk rock deterioration and structural failure could be related to the stone inherited ""geological"" features, biological attack by micro- (bacteria) and/or macro- (lichens) organisms is currently responsible for severe stone surface physical and chemical weathering leading to significant weakening of the stone texture and to material loss at the surface of the churches walls. A prompt and careful removal of the biological patinas with the correct biocidal treatment is therefore recommended. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Chemical weathering; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Geological history; Hydrothermal alterations; Relative contribution; Structural failure; UNESCO world heritages; Weathering process; Biological materials; Fracture mechanics; Religious buildings; Rock products; Scanning electron microscopy; Surfaces; Volcanic rocks; X ray spectroscopy; Weathering",,,09478396,,APAMF,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889085509

Multiple trauma is known to increase the risk of DAD through a sensitization mechanism. We investigate the hypothesis that resilience is a mediator of this mechanism. Methods Former Hidden Children (FHC), the Jewish youths who spent World War II in various hideaway shelters across Nazi-occupied Europe, were compared with a control group. In each group, we measured the presence of multiple traumas, the resilience with the Resilience Scale for Adults, which has a six factors solution, and the DAD with the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist. We test a mediated moderation model with childhood trauma as the predictor; Later trauma as the moderator; Resilience as the mediator; and DAD as the outcome variable. Results Results are consistent with a sensitization model of DAD mediated by resilience: confrontation with a primary trauma during childhood followed by secondary trauma(s) after childhood damages resilience, which, in turn, results in higher level of DAD. Limitations We are unable to differentiate if the sensitization process is a consequence of the nature of the trauma endured by FHC (long-standing exposure to extreme external events) or a consequence of the fact that this first trauma occurred during childhood. Conclusions Resilience construct is multi-factorial and a limited damaging of some of the factors is sufficient to lead to DAD even if other factors remain unaltered. Resilience can be altered by multiple traumas and, therefore, needs to be bolstered in therapy sessions.","Holocaust; Older adults; Resilience; Trauma","anxiety disorder; article; checklist; coping behavior; depression; Europe; holocaust; Hopkins Symptoms Checklist; jew; multiple trauma; outcome variable; priority journal; war; Holocaust; Older adults; Resilience; Trauma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety Disorders; Checklist; Child; Depression; Europe; Female; History, 20th Century; Holocaust; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Models, Psychological; Psychological Tests; Resilience, Psychological; Stress Disorders, Traumatic; World War II",,,01650327,,JADID,24103854,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886725397

This relies on being able to find pertinent information in that user's search history, which can be challenging for unseen queries and for new search scenarios. Building richer models of users' current and historic search tasks can help improve the likelihood of finding relevant content and enhance the relevance and coverage of personalization methods. The task-based approach can be applied to the current user's search history, or as we focus on here, all users' search histories as so-called ""groupization"" (a variant of personalization whereby other users' profiles can be used to personalize the search experience). We describe a method whereby we mine historic search-engine logs to find other users performing similar tasks to the current user and leverage their on-task behavior to identify Web pages to promote in the current ranking. We investigate the effectiveness of this approach versus query-based matching and finding related historic activity from the current user (i.e., group versus individual). As part of our studies we also explore the use of the on-task behavior of particular user cohorts, such as people who are expert in the topic currently being searched, rather than all other users. Our approach yields promising gains in retrieval performance, and has direct implications for improving personalization in search systems.

Methods: We describe the general methods for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and modeling used in this supplement, highlighting differences from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD2010) inputs and methods. For five conditions (preterm birth, retinopathy of prematurity, intrapartum-related conditions, neonatal infections, and neonatal jaundice), a standard three-step compartmental model was applied to estimate - by region, for 2010 - the numbers of (i) affected births by sex, (ii) postneonatal survivors, and (iii) impaired postneonatal survivors. For conditions included in GBD2010 analyses (preterm birth and intrapartum-related conditions), impairment at all ages was estimated, and disability weights were applied to estimate years lived with disability (YLD) and summed with years of life lost (YLL) to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Results: GBD2010 estimated neonatal conditions (preterm birth, intrapartum-related, neonatal sepsis, and ""other neonatal"") to be responsible for 202 million DALYs or 8.1% (7.3-9.0%) of the worldwide total. Mortality contributed 95% of the DALYs, and the estimated 26% reduction in neonatal condition DALYs since 1990 is primarily due to a 44% reduction in neonatal mortality rate due to these conditions, counterbalanced by increased numbers of babies born (17%). Impairment following neonatal conditions remained stable globally and is therefore relatively more important, especially in high- and middle-income countries. Crucial data gaps were identified. Conclusion: These results confirm neonatal conditions as a significant burden, reemphasizing the need to reduce deaths further, to count the linked 2.6 million stillbirths, and to better measure and address their long-term effects.

Ultimately, freedom - both individual and national - is shown to be victorious over slavery. Yet there is a tension within the novels between trauma and freedom. This essay explores that tension by tracing Grossman's use of time in depicting these dual phenomena, and specifically by analysing Nikolai Krymov's fate. The focus is in part on how his identity changes over time. Yet Grossman also employs different modes of temporality to depict the psychological effects of traumatic events, during which inner experience of time becomes fragmented and repetitive. Time and temporality provide the focus for a nuanced exploration of Krymov's identity and his eventual ability to attain freedom in the midst of traumatic repression. © The Author(s) 2013.","For a Just Cause; history; Life and Fate; time; trauma; Vasilii Grossman; World War II",,,,00472441,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888044936

Box 21, 90029 Oulu, Finland","Aim. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a significant morbid condition among the elderly. The epidemiology and natural history of this condition are poorly defined. Methods. Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the prevalence, incidence and natural history of CLI were performed. Results. Six studies reported on the prevalence of severe lower limb ischemia (ABI <0.60, ankle pressure <70 mmHg or Fontaine III-IV) in 82,923 subjects and its pooled prevalence was 800/100,000 population (95%CI 300-1400). The Oxford Vascular Study assessed the incidence of vascular events in the general population and estimated an incidence of CLI of 22/100,000 population per year (95%CI 17-28). Two studies reported an incidence of CLI in subjects >65 years old of 113 and 200/100,000 population per year, respectively. Nine studies reported on the treatment strategy in 2144 legs with CLI: the pooled rate of any revascularization procedure was 70.4%, of primary amputation 8.4%, and of conservative treatment 20.3%. After conservative treatment for CLI, one-year pooled leg salvage rate was 57.4% (95%CI 45.1-69.7%, ten studies reporting on 734 legs included), survival 75.4% (95%CI 59.2-91.6%, four studies included) and amputation-free survival 51.4% (95%CI 32.7-71.2%, five studies included). Conclusion. The incidence of CLI in the elderly is rather high. Series reporting on treatment strategies in these patients showed that a revascularization is attempted in 70% of cases. Conservative treatment in patients with unreconstructable CLI, high operative risk and/or refusing any revascularization procedure is associated with acceptable one year leg salvage.","Aged; Ischemia; Peripheral arterial disease","amputation; amputation free survival; ankle brachial index; ankle pressure; article; conservative treatment; critical limb ischemia; fontaine; gangrene; history; human; ICD-9-CM; incidence; leg ischemia; leg ulcer; medicare; meta analysis; pain; population; prevalence; rest; rest pain; revascularization; survival; systematic review; health; ischemia; leg; risk assessment; risk factor; vascular surgery; vascularization; ischemia; leg; review; vascularization; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Ischemia; Lower Extremity; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Vascular Surgical Procedures; Humans; Incidence; Ischemia; Lower Extremity; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Vascular Surgical Procedures; World Health",,,00219509,,JCVSA,24126504,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891539360

Survivors are at risk of adverse outcomes, and burden estimation at global and regional levels is critical for priority setting. Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment for surviving preterm babies according to the level of care. A compartmental model was used to estimate the number of impaired postneonatal survivors following preterm birth in 2010. A separate model (DisMod-MR) was used to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs) for the global burden of disease 2010 study. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLDs and years of life lost (YLLs). Results: In 2010, there were an estimated 13 million preterm births who survived beyond the first month. Of these, 345,000 (2.7%, uncertainty range: 269,000-420,000) were estimated to have moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, and a further 567,000 (4.4%, (445,000-732,000)) were estimated to have mild neurodevelopmental impairment. Many more have specific learning or behavioral impairments or reduced physical or mental health. Fewest data are available where the burden is heaviest. Preterm birth was responsible for 77 million DALYs, 3.1% of the global total, of which only 3 million were YLDs. Conclusion: Most preterm births (>90%) survive without neurodevelopmental impairment. Developing effective means of prevention of preterm birth should be a longer term priority, but major burden reduction could be made immediately with improved coverage and quality of care. Improved newborn care would reduce mortality, especially in low-income countries and is likely to reduce impairment in survivors, particularly in middle-income settings.

Hostility toward Germany led first to a decline in the popularity of breeds such as the dachshund, with both human and canine ""aliens"" targeted by nationalist fervor. Second, the institutions of dog breeding and showing came under threat from accusations of inappropriate luxury, frivolity, and the wasting of food in wartime, amounting to the charge of a want of patriotism on the part of breeders. Third, the paper shows how the ""dog fancy"" responded to this ""agitation against dogs,"" turning on mongrels, stray dogs, and ""useless"" and unpatriotic humans, exposing deep divisions within the dog breeding community. By looking at the politics of the ""dog fancy"" in wartime, this paper extends the discussion of animals and national identity, arguing that while dogs could be used to articulate patriotic sentiments, their conditional citizenship meant that they were uniquely vulnerable at a timeof national crisis. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","animals in history; Britishness; dog breeding; dog food; dog shows; dogs; nationalism; World War I",,,,10631119,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893046633

They transformed the ways in which architecture, design, and exhibits could come together in a stunning visual endpoint. The choice of 1960s social visionary and design guru F. Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome (""Bucky's Bubble"") for the US Pavilion structure proved a coup, as did the Marshall McLuhan-inspired Cambridge Seven design team that created the Pavilion interior of platforms joined by criss-crossing bridges and escalators. This article incorporates an analysis of four linked elements of the US Expo 67 design project. First, it conceives of the US Pavilion at the edge of US empire. Second, it suggests that, improbably, planners found success in the mix of earlier world's fair grand designs with a new minimalist modernity. Third, Pavilion design and content reflected the influence of Andy Warhol and other artists whose work was transforming gay camp into mass camp in American popular culture. Finally, the project drew on a secret World War II US army collaboration between three key Expo 67 planners, whose wartime specialty had been in military deception, to complete the visual revolution at the US Pavilion.","American Studies; Andy Warhol; Camp; Cultural Studies; Expo 67; F.

In the case of urban planning, the process of increasing state control over land, urban development and the built environment started specifically in 1937 with the establishment of the Delhi Improvement Trust and culminated with the formation of the Delhi Development Authority in 1957. At the same time the article also shows that despite this, Delhi's actual growth in this period often sidestepped state plans with the city's urban expansion being moulded by the impact of global events; emerging through the everyday actions of a vastly increased urban citizenry, especially following Partition, and also by the unexpected playing-out of increasing and exaggerated institutionalised state power itself, as described in the article.","DDA (Delhi development authority); Delhi; Dit (Delhi improvement trust); Partition; Urban planning; World War II","planning history; power relations; state role; urban development; urban planning; war; Delhi; India",,,00856401,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888091691

The decrease in the rate of mortality due to brain damage during the First World War resulted in a large number of veterans with neurological or neuropsychological sequelae. This situation, which was unknown up until then, called for the development of new therapeutic approaches to help them reach acceptable levels of autonomy. Development. This article reviews the relationship between neuropsychological rehabilitation and warfare, and describes the contributions made by different professionals in this field in the two great conflicts of the 20th century. The First World War was to mark the beginning of neuropsychological rehabilitation as we know it today. Some of the most outstanding contributions in that period were those made by Goldstein and Popplereuter in Germany or Franz in the United States. The Second World War was to consolidate this healthcare discipline, the leading figures at that time being Zangwill in England and Luria in the Soviet Union. Despite being of less importance, geopolitically speaking, the study also includes the Yom Kippur War, which exemplifies how warfare can stimulate the development of neuropsychological intervention programmes. Conclusions. Today's neuropsychological rehabilitation programmes are closely linked to the interventions used in wartime by Goldstein, Zangwill or Luria. The means employed may have changed, but the aims are still the same, i.e. to help people with brain damage manage to adapt to their new lives. © 2013 Revista de Neurología.","20th century history; Brain injury; Military medicine; Neuropsychology; Rehabilitation; War","article; brain damage; health care; human; neuropsychological rehabilitation; war; Brain Damage, Chronic; Brain Injuries; Combat Disorders; Europe; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Israel; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; Rehabilitation Centers; Russia; Spain; United States; War; World War I; World War II",,,02100010,,RVNRA,24203669,"English; Spanish",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887849901

The skill to handle the ball in a continuous manner, using set-place attacks, contributed to creating dangerous situations at the opponents' goals. The dominant ways of finishing attacks in the meetings under study are free kicks, without reception and simple kicks. Athletes of the Spain national team were not marked to deliver any attacks according to the previously designed and repeated playbooks.

This trend is playing a major role in changing the historical fabric and contexts of those cities. Predictably, the built heritage of Old Muscat is also being affected by urban expansion and development. This paper investigates the nature of the relationship between preservation of cultural heritage and urban expansion through a study of the way the defence sites of Muscat - the capital city of Oman- are managed. The paper investigates the points of collaboration and conflict between cultural heritage and urban expansion in Old Muscat, and looks at how a balance may possibly be maintained between them. The paper shows that various types of defence sites such as forts, castles, towers, walls, and gates represent an important part of the identity and history of the place. It also shows that although the defence sites of Old Muscat have received a relatively large amount of attention from urban planners, the management and utilization of these sites is questionable. It also shows that the modernization of the city, and the associated phenomenon of urban primacy, have both led to a cultural shift that is affecting people's perception of the defence sites. © 2013 WIT Press.","Built heritage; Defence sites; Heritage management; Muscat; Sultanate of Oman; Urban expansion; Urban primacy","Built heritage; Defence sites; Heritage managements; Muscat; Sultanate of Oman; Urban expansion; Urban primacy; Developing countries; Historic preservation; Maintenance; Urban growth; capital city; cultural heritage; developing world; heritage conservation; preservation; urban development; urban growth; urban history; Masqat [Oman]; Oman",,,17433509,9781845647308,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887578864

We therefore aimed to study injury-related mortality amongst NZ military forces in WW1. Methods An electronic version of the Roll-of-Honour for NZ Expeditionary Force (NZEF) personnel was supplemented with further coding and analysed statistically. We also performed literature searches to provide context. Results Out of a total of 16,703 deaths occurring during the war (28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918), injury deaths predominated: 65.1% were ""killed in action"" (KIA), 23.4% ""died of wounds"" (DOW), 1.0% were other injuries (e.g. ""accidents"", drownings, suicides and executions), and 10.5% were other causes (mainly disease). During the course of the war, the annual mortality rate from injury (for KIA + DOW) per 10,000 NZEF personnel in the North Hemisphere peaked at 1335 in 1915 (Gallipoli campaign) and then peaked again in 1917 at 937 (largely the Battle of Passchendaele). Some of the offensive campaigns involved very high mortality peaks (e.g. 2 days with over 450 deaths per day in October 1917). Conclusions Participation in First World War was by far the worst fatal injury event in New Zealand's history. Many of these injury deaths could be considered to have been preventable through: better diplomacy (to prevent the war), improved military planning to reduce failed campaigns (e.g. Gallipoli, Passchendaele), earlier use of protective equipment such as helmets, and improved healthcare services. © NZMA.",,"army; article; battle injury; female; health service; human; male; military medicine; mortality; New Zealand; nurse; seasonal variation; soldier; war; wound; Cause of Death; Female; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Military Personnel; New Zealand; Sex Distribution; World War I; Wounds and Injuries",,,00288446,,NZMJA,24217587,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887160439

First, it is explained how the charges of economism and ethnocentrism against the world city and global city concepts are ignoratio elenchi: they do not even begin to address or critique their neo-Marxist argument that, across the difference and diversity of the world's cities, a few major cities have the necessary economic specialization and therefore extraordinary function of commanding and controlling neoliberal globalization. Second, the error made by advocates of ordinary cities of supposing that world-systems analysis and the world city concept are forms of developmentalism is understood as the source for a wider postcolonial mistake of conflating the neo-Marxist world city and global city literatures with the very neoliberal practices toward urban development that they have long attempted to disclose and counter. Finally, the charges against the world city and global city concepts as paradigmatic, peripheralizing, and normative are also rebutted, not only to highlight how those critiques are consequentialist and dependent on the respective charges of economism, ethnocentrism, and developmentalism having veracity, but to demonstrate how an acceptance of the ordinary cities argument for an idiographic, provincial, nominalist, and comparative approach to urban studies, as an alternative to the two neo-Marxist concepts, is only to fall into the trap of making the mistake of confusing evidence of absence for absence of evidence.","Global city; Ordinary cities; Postcolonial urbanisms; World city","globalization; Marxism; neoliberalism; post-colonialism; urban economy; urban history; world city",,,0308518X,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886803795

A new and more expansive agenda must be articulated to ensure that those infants and children who will never feel the impact of the current elimination agenda are reached and linked to appropriate care and treatment. This agenda must addresses challenges around both reducing vertical transmission through PMTCT and ensuring access to appropriate HIV testing, care, and treatment for all affected children who were never able to access PMTCT programming. Option B+, or universal test and treat for HIV-infected pregnant women is an excellent start, but it may be time to rethink our current approaches to delivering PMTCT services. New strategies will reduce vertical transmission to less than 1% for those mother-infant pairs who can access them allowing for the contemplation of not just PMTCT, but actual elimination of MTCT.

Following the analysis of human teeth from Herculaneum (79 AD, Central Italy), the authors focused on linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) manifestations in order to delineate a possible correlation between their frequency and distribution and the earthquake that occurred in 62 AD, which is well documented in historical literature. The human remains from Herculaneum were buried at the same time as the Vesuvius eruption and represent an exceptional snapshot of life in the Roman Imperial Age. The Goodman and Rose method (1990) was used for attributing an ""age at the moment of stress"" for every skeleton in order to delineate the epidemiology of the enamel hypoplasia. When LEH frequency was analysed by age, two different age groups showed relevant patterns of hypoplasia: the first peak was evident in individuals between 14 and 20 years who were younger than 6 years at the time of the 62 AD earthquake, and a second peak was noted in adults of 30 ± 5 years old, which suggests the presence of another stressful event that occurred 10 years before the earthquake, around 53 AD. The bimodal distribution of enamel hypoplasia could be the consequence of two different historical periods characterized by instability in the food supply, unhygienic conditions, and epidemic episodes; our data suggest that the first peak could be related to a decline in health status as an effect of the 62 AD earthquake. The relationship between recent natural disasters and variations in health status in modern populations is well documented in scientific literature. Our research represents the first attempt to correlate the status of health to an earthquake of known date in an archaeological population. © 2013 E.

Diagnosis, however, is difficult and often overlooked, especially after arthroscopy in traction on fracture table; incidence is therefore not known exactly. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis was that incidence of pudendal nerve neuropathy exceeds 1% after hip arthroscopy. Materials and methods: Results for 150 patients (79 female, 71 male) undergoing hip arthroscopy between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. The principal assessment criterion was onset of pudendal neuralgia. Secondary criteria were risk factors (history, surgery time, type of anesthesia), associated complications, onset to diagnosis interval and pattern of evolution. Results: At a mean 93 months' follow-up, there were 3 cases (2 women, 1 man) (2%) of pure sensory pudendal neuralgia; 2 concerned labral lesion resection and 1 osteochondromatosis. Surgery time ranged from 60 to 120. min, under general anesthesia with curarization. Time to diagnosis was 3 weeks. No complementary examinations were performed. Spontaneous resolution occurred at 3 weeks to 6 months. No significant risk factors emerged. Conclusion: The present study found 2% incidence of pudendal neuralgia, with no risk factors emerging from analysis. Prevention involves limiting traction force and duration by using a large pelvic support (diameter > 8-10. cm). Patient information and postoperative screening should be systematic.

Wage inequality is measured by the gap between skilled and unskilled labour, and reveals a downward trend in most of the period in analysis. We provide an explanation for the observed trends by looking at the influence of domestic and international forces on changes in the relative supply and demand of skilled labour. According to our findings, the skill premium declined due to the combined influence of two major forces: an increase in the relative supply of skilled labour due to the mass emigration of unskilled labour, and the decrease in the relative demand for skills, related to trade-induced changes stemming from the country's increasing openness, which followed the country's unskilled labour comparative advantages. Our findings point to the conclusion that the impact of openness on wage inequality is related to the country's relative level of development among its major trading partners. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","economic growth; international trade; Portugal; structural change; wage inequality","developing world; economic growth; economic history; international trade; skilled labor; structural change; wage gap; Portugal",,,03585522,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887045726

Over the past three decades, much progress has been made in reducing agricultural protection in high-income countries and agricultural disincentives in developing countries. However, plenty of price distortions remain. As well, the propensity of governments to insulate their domestic food market from fluctuations in international prices has not waned. Such insulation contributes to the amplification of international food price fluctuations, yet it does little to advance national food security when food-importing and food-exporting countries equally engage in insulating behavior. Thus there is still much scope to improve global economic welfare via multilateral agreement not only to remove remaining trade distortions but also to desist from varying trade barriers when international food prices gyrate. This article summarizes indicators of trends and fluctuations in farm trade barriers before examining unilateral or multilateral trade arrangements, together with complementary domestic measures, that could lead to better global food security outcomes. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.","Export taxation; Farmer protection; Food price spikes; Trade policy history","agricultural economics; agricultural price; agricultural trade; developing world; economic development; economic reform; food market; food security; poverty; subsidy system; subsistence agriculture; trade policy; urban policy",,,01695150,,AECNB,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888201558

How are Latvian women volunteers of the Red Army represented and remembered in Soviet and post-Soviet historical accounts of World War II? Why have they not been remembered in most historical accounts of this period? How are ethnicity, gender, and associated social roles implicated in their historical marginality? These questions are situated in the context of literature on collective memory and microsociological literature on social roles, and used to develop the analytical concept of the unruly actor - historical actors who are challenges to dominant memory narratives because they fail to conform to normative social roles ascribed on the basis of, among others, gender and ethnicity.

Surprisingly, the relationship between stable isotope these values characteristics and the percentage of marine foods in diet has never been effectively demonstrated. To clarify this relationship, the stable isotope values and radiocarbon dates of nine humans and one sheep from Herculaneum, all who perished simultaneously during the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius, were determined. Significant differences were found in the radiocarbon dates which are attributable to the incorporation of ""old"" carbon from the marine reservoir. The magnitude of the observed differences was linearly correlated with both δ13C and δ15N values allowing the response of each isotope to increasing marine carbon in collagen to be independently verified. Regression analyses showed that for every 1‰ enrichment in δ13C and δ15N, 56 years and 34 years were added to the radiocarbon age, respectively. Predictions of the maximum marine reservoir age differed considerably depending on which stable isotope was considered. This discrepancy is attributed to some degree of macronutrient scrambling whereby nitrogen from marine protein is preferentially incorporated in collagen over marine carbon. It is suggested that the macronutrient scrambling explains the observed relationship between δ13C and δ15N from Roman coastal sites and should be considered when interpreting any diet which is not dominated by protein. Nevertheless, without knowing the degree of macronutrient scrambling in different dietary scenarios, the accuracy of dietary reconstructions is severely compromised.

Changes occurred in both arenas which influenced the stability of the regime and led the country to a civil war. In the domestic political arena, the regime ceased to rely on a Maronite-Sunni-Shiite axis and began to rely firstly on a Maronite-Shiite axis, and then on a Maronite-Druze axis. These steps aroused the Sunni establishment against the regime and led to instability. In the foreign arena, the regime exchanged their policy of neutrality on Arab and international arenas in favour of leaning towards 'revolutionary' Arab countries such as Syria, Iraq and Libya. This led to a rise in the influence and intervention of these Arab countries in Lebanese political affairs and escalated the turbulence on the streets of Lebanon against the Frangieh regime. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,"Arab world; civil war; policy analysis; political history; political power; Iraq; Lebanon; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Syrian Arab Republic",,,00263206,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889242584

J. Dev. Biol. and Marc Van Montagu. Research in the group of Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell in the 1970s was essential to reveal how the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers DNA to host plants to cause crown gall disease. Knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying gene transfer, subsequently led to the development of plant transgene technology, an indispensable tool in fundamental plant research and plant improvement. In the early 1980s, Marc Van Montagu founded a start-up company, Plant Genetic Systems, which successfully developed insect-resistant plants, herbicide-tolerant plants and a hybrid seed production system based on nuclear male sterility. Even before the first transgenic plant had been produced, Marc Van Montagu realized that the less developed countries might benefit most from plant biotechnology and throughout his subsequent career, this remained a focus of his efforts. After becoming emeritus professor, he founded the Institute of Plant Biotechnology Outreach (IPBO), which aims to raise awareness of the major role that plant biotechnology can play in sustainable agricultural systems, especially in less developed countries. Marc Van Montagu has been honored with many prizes and awards, the most recent being the prestigious World Food Prize 2013.

Access to quality maternal health services mainly depends on existing policies, regulations, skills, knowledge, perceptions, and economic power and motivation of service givers and target users. Critics question policy recommending involvement of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in emergency obstetric care (EmoC) services in developing countries. Objectives. This paper reports about knowledge and practices of TBAs on EmoC in Kigoma Rural District, Tanzania and discusses policy implications on involving TBAs in maternal health services. Methods. 157 TBAs were identified from several villages in 2005, interviewed and observed on their knowledge and practice in relation to EmoC. Quantitative and qualitative techniques were used for data collection and analysis depending on the nature of the information required. Findings. Among all 157 TBAs approached, 57.3% were aged 50+ years while 50% had no formal education. Assisting mothers to deliver without taking their full pregnancy history was confessed by 11% of all respondents. Having been attending pregnant women with complications was experienced by 71.2% of all respondents. Only 58% expressed adequate knowledge on symptoms and signs of pregnancy complications. Lack of knowledge on possible risk of HIV infections while assisting childbirth without taking protective gears was claimed by 5.7% of the respondents. Sharing the same pair of gloves between successful deliveries was reported to be a common practice by 21.1% of the respondents. Use of unsafe delivery materials including local herbs and pieces of cloth for protecting themselves against HIV infections was reported as being commonly practiced among 27.6% of the respondents. Vaginal examination before and during delivery was done by only a few respondents. Conclusion: TBAs in Tanzania are still consulted by people living in underserved areas. Unfortunately, TBAs' inadequate knowledge on EmOC issues seems to have contributed to the rising concerns about their competence to deliver the recommended maternal services. Thus, the authorities seeming to recognize and promote TBAs should provide support to TBAs in relation to necessary training and giving them essential working facilities, routine supportive supervision and rewarding those seeming to comply with the standard guidelines for delivering EmoC services. © 2013 Vyagusa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Maternal health; Obstetric care; Pregnancy; Tanzania; Traditional birth attendants","birth date; childbearing; community health worker; developing world; guideline; human immunodeficiency virus; neonate; policy implementation; pregnancy; traditional knowledge; village; adult; age; article; childbirth; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; educational status; emergency care; glove; health care policy; health care practice; health care survey; herbal medicine; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; interview; knowledge; maternal care; medical history; pelvic examination; pregnancy complication; priority journal; protective clothing; rural area; symptom assessment; Tanzania; traditional birth attendant; Kigoma [Tanzania]; Tanzania; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Emergencies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Maternal Health Services; Middle Aged; Midwifery; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Tanzania; Young Adult",,,14759276,,,24124663,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885358722

The aim of this study was to assess the association between VPCs and risk of sudden cardiac death or total cardiac death in general populations by conducting a meta-analysis of published research. The electronic databases MEDLINE and Embase were searched for relevant studies. Data were abstracted using standardized forms. Study-specific relative risk estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Eleven studies comprising a total of 106,195 participants sampled from general populations were included. Studies generally defined frequent VPCs as occurring ≥1 time during a standard electrocardiographic recording or ≥30 times over a 1-hour recording. The prevalence of frequent VPCs in the studies ranged from 1.2% to 10.7%. The overall adjusted relative risk for sudden cardiac death comparing participants with frequent VPCs versus those without frequent VPCs was 2.64 (95% confidence interval 1.93 to 3.63). The corresponding value for total cardiac death was 2.07 (95% confidence interval 1.71 to 2.50). Although most studies made attempts to exclude high-risk subjects, such as those with histories of cardiovascular disease, they did not test participants for underlying structural heart disease. In conclusion, findings from observational studies in general populations indicate that frequent VPCs are associated with a substantial increase in the risk for sudden cardiac death and total cardiac death. Further study is needed to determine the role of confounding and underlying structural heart disease in the observed association and its utility in cardiovascular risk prediction. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Throughout his life, Harvey worked as a tireless and thoughtful researcher and a transmitter and intermediary between the ancient Greek natural philosophers and physicians and the ""moderns,"" for whom he founded two forward-looking, interlinked sciences: modern physiology and nascent cardiology. Harvey's methodology and demonstrations were of such fundamental and standardizing nature as to secure the sure progress of these two sciences. Thus, he rendered to them such a service as Descartes's cogito ergo sum furnished to Philosophy in giving it a rational standard of certainty, for want of which the more speculative minds of that era were inundated with extraordinary conjectures. If Harvey disproved Galen, he absorbed and continued in his physiologic research many a principle from Aristotle, whose supreme disciple he remains. The guidance and authority of Aristotle were strong with him to the end. Harvey's account of the motions of the heart and blood in the circulation demonstrated that complex physiological systems can be represented in straightforward mechanical terms, a concept which has remained fundamental to the present day. The philosophical implication of William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was the resolute application of the experimental method to cardiology. In my judgment, he established today's forward-looking discipline of translational cardiovascular research. In due course, he should be widely acknowledged to have done so. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Greek natural philosophy and Harveian structure-function correlations; Harvey's extension of Aristotle and transformation of Galen; Harvey's Socratis regula or Socrates' rule for interrogation across numerous animal species; Harvey's study of arterial pulsatile flow; Historical continuity in the methodology of modern medical science; Systolic contraction as the motus proprius or characteristic action of the heart","biomechanics; bionics; blood flow; cardiology; cardiovascular system; comparative anatomy; functional anatomy; Greece; heart atrium function; heart cycle; heart movement; heart muscle cell; heart ventricle function; history of medicine; human; medical research; methodology; modern times; nonhuman; philosophy of medicine; priority journal; pulse wave; review; suction pump; systole; translational research; Greek natural philosophy and Harveian structure-function correlations; Harvey's extension of Aristotle and transformation of Galen; Harvey's Socratis regula or Socrates' rule for interrogation across numerous animal species; Harvey's study of arterial pulsatile flow; Historical continuity in the methodology of modern medical science; Systolic contraction as the motus proprius or characteristic action of the heart; Blood Circulation; Cardiology; Greek World; Heart; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, Ancient; Humans; Teaching",,,01675273,,IJCDD,23972367,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886295276

Since its establishment, the NDDTC has played a major role in the development of various replicable models of care, the training of post-graduate students of psychiatry, research, policy development and planning. An assessment of the magnitude of drug abuse in India began in the early 1990s and this was followed by a National Survey on Extent, Patterns and Trends of Drug Abuse in 2004. Several models of clinical care have been developed for population subgroups in diverse settings. The centre played an important role in producing data and resource material which helped to scale up opioid substitution treatment in India. A nationwide database on the profile of patients seeking treatment (Drug Abuse Monitoring System) at government drug treatment centres has also been created. The centre has provided valuable inputs for the Government of India's programme planning. Besides clinical studies, research has also focused on pre-clinical studies. Capacity-building is an important priority, with training curricula and resource material being developed for doctors and paramedical staff. Many of these training programmes are conducted in collaboration with other institutions in the country. The NDDTC has received funding from several national and international organizations for research and scientific meetings, and, most recently (2012), it has been designated as a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Substance Abuse. © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Collaborations; India; National centre; Policy development; Research; Substance use; Training; Treatment","addiction; article; Collaborations; cooperation; drug dependence treatment; history; human; India; management; national centre; organization and management; policy development; program development; research; substance use; training; treatment; world health organization; Behavior, Addictive; drug dependence treatment; organization and management; Substance-Related Disorders; Collaborations; India; national centre; policy development; research; substance use; training; treatment; Behavior, Addictive; Cooperative Behavior; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; India; Policy Making; Program Development; Research; Substance Abuse Treatment Centers; Substance-Related Disorders; World Health Organization; Behavior, Addictive; Cooperative Behavior; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; India; Policy Making; Program Development; Research; Substance Abuse Treatment Centers; Substance-Related Disorders; World Health Organization",,,09652140,,ADICE,23075217,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884211111

A cross-referenced survey of these texts suggests that the contemporary theories on the subject may have gone far beyond the well-known attribution of epilepsy and other diseases to disorders in the flow of pneuma within the vessels. A pattern of co-dependent interplay between air-pneuma and fire-heat is evident among the different sources, despite disagreements of the authors on general outlook and other matters. The mutual engagement of those two elements, in turn, is found woven into elaborate mechanisms to explain, with a cause-to-effect approach, vital processes such as the regulation of body temperature through respiration, embryonic growth through morphogenetic differentiation, and even plant germination. Viewed in a historical context, these features suggest that Hippocratic speculation about pneuma may be representative of a conceptual bridging step, i.e., a stage intermediate between some seminal precedents of Presocratic thought and the more mature Aristotelian and Hellenistic theories. © The Author 2012.

This posed a considerable challenge for the military and medical authorities and resulted in an active discussion on the etiology and treatment of these disorders. Current historiography is reliant on published physician accounts, and this represents the first study of treatment approaches based on original case notes. We analyzed patient records from two leading departments of academic psychiatry in Germany, those at Berlin and Jena, in conjunction with the contemporaneous medical literature. Treatment, which can be broadly classified into reward and punishment, suggestion, affective shock, cognitive learning, and physiological methods, was developed in the context of the emerging fields of animal learning and neurophysiology. A further innovative feature was the use of quantitative methods to assess outcomes. These measures showed good response rates, though most cured patients were not sent back to battle because of their presumed psychopathic constitution. While some treatments appear unnecessarily harsh from today's perspective and were also criticized by leading psychiatrists of the time, the concentration of effort and involvement of so many senior doctors led to the development of psychotherapeutic methods that were to influence the field of psychiatric therapy for decades to come. © Author 2012.

Through this knowledge, preventive strategies have been designed and instituted, and prospective parents are counseled regarding their risk of having an affected child. Great strides have been made in genetic variant identification, and genetic susceptibility to environmental exposures has been hypothesized as an etiology for congenital heart defects. Unfortunately, similar advances in understanding have not been made regarding strategies to prevent nongenetic risk factors. Less information is available regarding the potential adverse effect of modifiable risk factors on the fetal heart. This review summarizes the available literature on these modifiable exposures that may alter the risk for congenital heart disease. Information regarding paternal characteristics and conditions, maternal therapeutic drug exposures, parental nontherapeutic drug exposures, and parental environmental exposures are presented. Factors are presented in terms of risk for congenital heart defects as a group. These factors also are broken down by specific defect type.

However, it is unclear whether the prognostic significance of low SBP differs in patients with versus without prior history of hypertension. We sought to investigate the relationships between presenting SBP, prior hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, and outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). Methods Using data from GRACE/GRACE2 and CANRACE, we stratified 10,337 patients with NSTEACS from 1999 to 2008 into 2 groups: those with and those without prior diagnosis of hypertension. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the prognostic significance of prior hypertension on in-hospital mortality and tested for the interactions between prior hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, and presenting SBP. Results Compared with patients without prior hypertension (n = 3,732), those with prior hypertension (n = 6,605) were older; more likely to be female; and more frequently had diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal insufficiency, and higher Killip class and GRACE risk scores on presentation. Patients with prior hypertension were more likely to be on antihypertensive medications before admission, to present with higher SBP, and to have heart failure or cardiogenic shock in hospital (6.0% vs 10.1%; P &lt;.001). In-hospital mortality was higher among patients presenting with lower SBP but did not differ between the groups with and without prior hypertension. In multivariable analysis, neither prior hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.15, 95% CI 0.78-1.70, P =.48) nor the number of antihypertensive medications used (P for trend =.84) was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. In contrast, SBP was a strong independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21 per 10 mm Hg lower, 1.15-1.27, P &lt;.001). There was no significant interaction between SBP and prior hypertension (P for interaction =.62) or pre-admission antihypertensive medication use (P for interaction =.46) with respect to in-hospital mortality. Conclusion Low SBP on presentation, but not prior hypertension, was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in NSTEACS. The powerful prognostic value of SBP is similar regardless of a history of hypertension or pre-admission antihypertensive medication use. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fibrinogen receptor antagonist; heparin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; age distribution; aged; article; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; heart catheterization; heart failure; heart infarction; human; hypertension; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; medical history; non st segment elevation acute coronary syndrome; outcome assessment; percutaneous coronary intervention; predictor variable; priority journal; prognosis; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; Blood Pressure; Electrocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; World Health",,,00028703,,AHJOA,24093852,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885188946

In the National Socialist (NS) period this changed. Universities could count on ""extraordinary opportunities for cadaver delivery."" Most frequently tacitly, many bodies were those of victims of NS crimes. Scientists increasingly exploited the exceptional political situation to systematically supplement their institutional collections. Their endeavors to fill the, in their terms, ""lamentable gaps"" in their collections took on truly bizarre forms. In Austria, Jewish cemeteries were plundered for racial-political expansion of anatomical collections. A change in paradigm was merely the next step: intentional murder for the benefit of NS-oriented science. In December of 1942, anatomists meeting in Tübingen discussed plans for ""material acquisition."" August Hirt, director of the anatomical institute at the Reichsuniversität in Strasbourg, was to develop guidelines. There was express reference to ""Auftrag Beger,"" which had already been conceived although not yet realized: at the behest of Hirt and the SS-scientific organization, ""Ahnenerbe,"" the anthropologists Bruno Beger and Hans Fleischhacker selected 86 Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz in June of 1943 and deported them to the concentration camp at Struthof near Natzweiler, where they were murdered. The bodies were delivered to the anatomy department in Strasbourg for preparation and used as anatomical specimens. The Reichsuniversität Strasbourg was considered a center of excellence for Nazi ideology. For modern scientists, the elucidation of these criminal acts is not exhausted in the search for an answer to the questions of perpetrator, place, modus operandi or motive.

Methods: Household residents from 10 provinces were randomly recruited and interviewed by Statistics Canada. 10,601 participants who were aged 18 years and older and who did not meet the criteria for MDE in the 12 months prior to a baseline interview in 2000101 were included in algorithm development; data from 7902 participants who were aged 18 and older and who were free of MDE in 2004105 were used for validation. Validation was also conducted in sub-populations that are of practice and policy importance. MDE was assessed using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-Short Form for Major Depression (CIDI-SFMD). Results: In the training data, the C statistics for algorithms in men was 07953 and was 07667 for algorithm in women. The algorithms had good predictive power and calibrated well in the development and validation data. Limitations: The data relied on self-report. MDE was assessed with CIDI-SFMD. It was not feasible to validate the algorithms in different populations from different countries. Conclusions: More studies are needed to further validate and refine these algorithms. However, the ability of a small number of easily assessed variables to predict MDE risk indicates that algorithms are a promising strategy for identifying individuals in need of enhanced monitoring and preventive interventions. Ultimately, application of algorithms may lead to increased personalization of treatment, and better clinical outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Regressive fantasies and alliances within and to the group are determined by group composition and the interaction of fantasies among members and leader. Bion's useful but incomplete early abstract formulation of psychic regression in groups was the initial attempt to move beyond Freud's largely sociological view.

Included were patients who received dexamethasone for suspected allergic reactions after receiving parenterally administered Dengzhan Xixin. These were compared with non-allergic reaction people. Single factor logistic regression and multiple factor logistic regression were used to analyze data. Condition on admission, allergic history, dosage, disease status and drug combinations were taken into account in cases of suspected allergic reactions. After analysis we found that the condition on admission had a significant effect, P=0.0083, OR value=5.642 on suspected cases of allergic reactions.

Glick openly discusses his views about the widespread practice of their subjection to experiments without benefit or unrelated to their conditions. In opposition, Burchell claims that accusations of ethical misconduct during this period were exaggerated, and that most of these studies would pass review boards today.

The article argues that historians working on the cultural history of this reception have alternated between an overall understanding of this interregional entanglement as either an image, in the meaning of a projection, or an actual influence upon European developments. The image approach and the influence approach are shown to be mutually exclusive, and this is explained by relating the specialized results of the field to the debates on ""the West"" and ""the Other"" that reached an apex with Edward Said's Orientalism. Therefore, apart from presenting a complete state of the art for this field, the article analyzes how the ethical and political research debates of the 1970s made the concept of influence untenable until other branches of world history had been insisting on world historical entanglements for almost a decade in the beginning of the 2000s. © 2013 by University of Hawai'i Press.",,"cultural history; cultural influence; image; Orientalism; Western world; China; Europe",,,10456007,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887509255

Methods: A population-based study was conducted in Italian areas covered by cancer registries and OCSPs. The study included all women aged 25-65. years diagnosed with ICC between 1995 and 2008, and their screening histories within OCSPs were retrieved. Hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed according to screening pattern, using Cox models adjusted for age, ICC stage, and major confounders. Results: Among 3268 women with ICC, 20% were never-invited to OCSP, 36% were never-compliant with OCSP's invitation, 33% were compliant and had a screen-detected ICC within OCSP (i.e., after a positive cytology), and 11% were compliant but had a non-screen-detected ICC. Screen-detected ICCs were more frequently micro-invasive (42%) compared to non-screen-detected ones (14%). Compared to women with screen-detected ICC, the adjusted HRs of death were 1.9 (95% CI 1.5-2.4) for those never-invited, 2.0 (95% CI 1.6-2.5) for never-compliant, and 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.4) for compliant women having non-screen-detected ICC. Conclusion: Prolonged survival, beyond down-staging, of women with ICC detected within OCSPs in Italy, further calls for improvements of OCSPs' invitational coverage and participation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Cervical cancer; Cytology; Organized screening program; Screening history","adult; aged; article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer registry; cancer screening; cancer staging; cancer survival; controlled study; female; follow up; histology; human; human tissue; Italy; major clinical study; priority journal; squamous cell; survival rate; tumor invasion; uterine cervix cancer; Cancer Registry; Cervical cancer; CI; confidence interval; CR; Cytology; FIGO; hazard ratio; HR; ICC; ICD; International Classification of Diseases; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics; invasive cervical cancer; NOS; not otherwise specified; OCSP; odds ratio; OR; organized cervical screening program; Organized screening program; Screening history; WHO; World Health Organization; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Italy; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Survival Rate; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears",,,00917435,,PVTMA,23732239,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881609346

The cardiology community is faced with the challenge of providing a sensible strategy for the prevention of SCD while simultaneously reaffirming that the benefits of regular exercise far outweigh potential risks. At present, there is a broad range of screening recommendations dependent upon country, sporting discipline, and competition level. While much recent debate has focused on the efficacy of screening with electrocardiography, a number of sporting bodies also mandate the inclusion of exercise testing and echocardiography in screening protocols. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, coronary calcium scoring and computed tomography coronary angiography have also been promoted as potentially valuable screening tools for competitive athletes. This review will examine the controversial topic of utilizing cardiac imaging for athlete pre-participation screening. Specifically, the limitations of screening for relatively rare disorders using imaging tools with uncertain or imperfect accuracy will be addressed. Current evidence suggests that the accuracy of all cardiac imaging modalities is insufficient to justify their use as primary screening modalities in athletes. Atypical findings such as marked cardiac dilation, reduced deformation, or small patches of delayed gadolinium enhancement may be commonly encountered in well-trained athletes, but, at present, the prognostic significance of such findings is unknown. Resulting uncertainty for the clinician and athlete has the potential for psychological stress, further testing, and unnecessary exclusions from competition. However, these concerns must not be confused with the extremely useful applications of cardiac imaging for the assessment of athletes with symptoms, an abnormal electrocardiogram or a positive family history. As modern imaging further enhances our understanding of the spectrum of athlete's heart, its role may expand from the assessment of athletes with suspected disease to being part of comprehensive pre-participation screening in apparently healthy athletes. © 2013 By Theamerican College of Cardiology Foundation.","athlete's heart; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular; risk prediction; screening exercise; sudden cardiac death","gadolinium; article; athlete; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical assessment; coronary artery calcium score; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; exercise test; family history; groups by age; human; incidence; mental stress; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; risk factor; running; screening test; sudden cardiac death; arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; ARVC; athlete's heart; BAV; bicuspid aortic valve; CACS; cardiac magnetic resonance; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular screening; CHD; CMR; computed tomography coronary angiography; coronary artery calcium scoring; coronary heart disease; CTCA; delayed gadolinium enhancement; DGE; ECG; electrocardiogram; exercise; HCM; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; left ventricle; LV; maximal oxygen uptake; right ventricle; risk prediction; RV; SCD; sudden cardiac death; VO(2)max; Athletes; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Coronary Angiography; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Diagnostic Imaging; Echocardiography, Stress; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Survival Rate; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; World Health",,,1936878X,,,24029371,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883866343

The 1997/1998 Asian economic crisis acted as a significant brake on development, the effects of which were not felt immediately. Later manifestation has raised many problems related to skill development, shortage of quality route length and proper accountability. The adoption of democracy post 1998 with regionalisation in 1999, although laudable from a political and inclusive viewpoint, has led to related operational issues that need to be addressed. Indonesia has a satisfactory gross domestic product of greater than 6%, consumer driven and expected to continue in the years ahead.

The history of first (after World War I) and second (after World War II) wave émigré nurses, integrated into the broader historical narrative, reveals that professional identity was just as important to these women as national identity. This became especially so after World War II, when Russian and Soviet refugee nurses resettled in the West. Individual accounts become interwoven on an international canvas that brings together a wide range of personal experiences from women based in Russia, the Soviet Union, China, Yugoslavia, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere.

In these circumstances, the agent is unable to devote infinite cognitive resources to represent the optimal strategy that needs to be played against each opponent. We investigate this type of game, where a player, called the focal player, playing concurrently against multiple opponents independent 2-player games. Nevertheless, these games are coupled through the shared memory resource available to the agent. Each opponent has a fixed strategy. While the history length may vary from one opponent to another, the focal player doesn't know the opponents' strategies or which history length is used by which opponent. All the focal player can observe is the opponents' actions. We use evolutionary computation to decide on an appropriate allocation of memory to opponents. We show-given that opponents are using fixed strategies-that the memory distribution relies on the number of active bits (i.e., bits which generates a repeated pattern with a favorable payoff) that the focal player needs to exploit its opponents' strategies. We show how our current results relate to the minimum required number of bits for a player to face a set of opponents with fixed strategies, and how the number of active bits increases as the richness of the opponent strategy-measured using entropy-increases. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Cognitive resources; Fixed strategy; History length; Optimal strategies; Real world situations; Repeated patterns; Shared memory; Strategy games; Evolutionary algorithms; Calculations",,,,9781479904549,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881582877

A history of symptoms compatible with dengue can be traced back to the Chin Dynasty of 265-420 AD. The virus and its vectors have now become widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly over the last half-century. Significant geographic expansion has been coupled with rapid increases in incident cases, epidemics, and hyperendemicity, leading to the more severe forms of dengue. Transmission of dengue is now present in every World Health Organization (WHO) region of the world and more than 125 countries are known to be dengue endemic. The true impact of dengue globally is difficult to ascertain due to factors such as inadequate disease surveillance, misdiagnosis, and low levels of reporting. Currently available data likely grossly underestimates the social, economic, and disease burden. Estimates of the global incidence of dengue infections per year have ranged between 50 million and 200 million; however, recent estimates using cartographic approaches suggest this number is closer to almost 400 million. The expansion of dengue is expected to increase due to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement and also viral evolution. No vaccine or specific antiviral therapy currently exists to address the growing threat of dengue. Prompt case detection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the mortality from severe dengue. Effective vector control is the mainstay of dengue prevention and control. Surveillance and improved reporting of dengue cases is also essential to gauge the true global situation as indicated in the objectives of the WHO Global Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control, 2012-2020. More accurate data will inform the prioritization of research, health policy, and financial resources toward reducing this poorly controlled disease. The objective of this paper is to review historical and current epidemiology of dengue worldwide and, additionally, reflect on some potential reasons for expansion of dengue into the future. © 2013 Murray et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Climate change; Evolution; Geographic expansion; Travel","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; Africa; climate change; control strategy; data analysis; dengue; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; Dengue virus 4; diagnostic error; disease carrier; disease severity; disease surveillance; disease transmission; economic aspect; endemic disease; environmental temperature; epidemiological data; Europe; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; fever; genotype; geographic distribution; health care policy; history; human; humidity; incidence; infection rate; infection risk; infection sensitivity; mortality; mosquito; nonhuman; pathogen load; research priority; resource management; review; risk factor; social aspect; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; symptomatology; travel; tropical disease; tropics; vector control; viral clearance; viral genetics; virus detection; virus infection; virus replication; virus virulence; voluntary reporting; weather; Western Hemisphere; world health organization",,,11791349,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882734612

We detail two attack scenarios. The first is redirecting the victim's browser as it moves from a store to a payment provider, and the second redirects the victim to a phishing page, when she navigates to one of a set of target sites. A key issue in flow stealing is correctly timing the redirect. The main way to accomplish this is to leverage a history detection attack to test whether the victim has visited a target. By repeatedly polling, an attacker learns when the victim navigates to a tested target page. With this application, we demonstrate that the impact of history detection is greater than previously known. Our primary history detection mechanism is a cache timing attack, measuring the time it takes to load an element to determine if it was served from the browser cache. This attack works with present browser versions. We also discuss CSS history detection, based on detecting the styling of visited links, which has been solved in most browsers. Lastly, we also consider a network-based attacker who can mount a man-in-the-middle attack on the victim's network traffic. We discuss several countermeasures against flow stealing. These include two new proposed policies on JavaScript window navigation which can be implemented by browser vendors. We also present mitigations which can be implemented by individual stores or payment providers. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

Forensic Analysis techniques on systems are often successful at recovering information said to have been deleted in the past. Efforts aimed at thwarting such forensic analysis of systems have either focused on (i) identifying the system components where deleted data lingers and performing a secure delete operation over these remnants, or (ii) designing history independent data structures that hide information about past operations which result in the current system state. Yet, new data is constantly derived by processing existing (input) data which makes it increasingly difficult to remove all traces of this existing data, i.e., for regulatory compliance purposes. Even after deletion, significant information can linger in and be recoverable from the side effects the deleted data records left on the currently available state. In this paper we address this aspect in the context of a relational database, such that when combined with (i) & (ii), complete erasure of data and its effects can be achieved (""un-traceable deletion""). We introduce Ficklebase - a relational database wherein once a tuple has been ""expired"" - any and all its side-effects are removed, thereby eliminating all its traces, rendering it unrecoverable, and also guaranteeing that the deletion itself is undetectable. We present the design and evaluation of Ficklebase, and then discuss several of the fundamental functional implications of un-traceable deletion. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Design and evaluations; Digital world; Forensic analysis; History independent data-structures; Relational Database; System components; System functions; System state; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Regulatory compliance",,,10844627,9781467349086,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881344120

At this occasion in this article selected historical data are updated, and the achievements and future perspectives of the WAAVP are discussed. Although the WAAVP is a small association with only a few hundred members, it has been able to develop remarkable activities. Between 1963 and 2011 the WAAVP has organized 23 international scientific congresses, and the 24th conference will take place in Perth, Western Australia, in 2013. These conferences have achieved a high degree of international recognition as indicated by relatively large numbers of participants (up to ~800). Furthermore, the WAAVP has promoted veterinary parasitology in various ways, such as publishing international guidelines (efficacy evaluation of antiparasitic drugs, parasitological methods, standardized nomenclature of animal parasitic diseases ""SNOAPAD""), stimulating international discussions on teaching and continued education (""colleges of veterinary parasitology"") and by supporting the high quality journal ""Veterinary Parasitology"" which is the official organ of the WAAVP. In retrospect, the development of the WAAVP can be classified as very successful. New challenges associated with global changes (growth of the world population, urbanization, climate change, new developments in animal and plant production, etc.) will require new efforts in research in various fields, including veterinary parasitology. Future activities of WAAVP may include inter alia: (a) support of international parasitological networks; (b) stimulation of coordinated research aimed at the solution of defined problems; (c) increasing the exposure of WAAVP to parasitology from hitherto neglected regions of the world; (d) strengthening of official links to international organizations (FAO, WHO, etc.); (e) continuation of guideline preparation; and (d) preparation and international distribution of high quality electronic programs for self-education in veterinary parasitology. © 2013.","50th anniversary; Achievements of WAAVP; Guidelines; World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP)","acaricide; anthelmintic agent; antiparasitic agent; achievement; animal parasitosis; article; climate change; drug efficacy; helminthiasis; history; human; international cooperation; medical education; medical literature; medical research; medical society; nomenclature; nonhuman; parasitology; population growth; practice guideline; quality control; standardization; urbanization; veterinary medicine; animal; animal parasitosis; art; education; organization; parasitology; trends; veterinary medicine; Animalia; Animals; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Parasitology; Societies; Veterinary Medicine",,,03044017,,VPARD,23683652,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880039168

Urban geoarchaeology is focused on site accumulation, collapse, weathering and erosion, as constrained by architectural plans and structures. These may document settlement growth and decay, as well as environmental history, posing a multidisciplinary challenge of interactive and fluctuating processes.Part of a World Heritage site, the Lost City of the Pyramids (Heit el-Ghurab), at the desert and floodplain margins of Giza, was centered on a Workmen's Town that channeled the roles of seasonal workmen, artisans, and administrators during construction of the Menkaure Pyramid and preparation of the funerary cult for that pharaoh (∼2532-2503 BCE). Built across a normally dry wadi course, the site was badly chosen and vulnerable to a coeval high-amplitude precipitation anomaly of perhaps 120 yr, during which mudbrick meltdown, catastrophic flash floods, and mass-movements destroyed the royal complex of mudbrick galleries, workshops and bread-making kilns once every 4 years or so. In addition, thick alluvial fans advanced 1 km or more across the Nile floodplain, before dissection was initiated by downcutting channels. Despite this dynamic environmental history, the site was repeatedly rebuilt and ruined, with structural and human consequences.This Old Kingdom (Dynasty 4) paleoclimatic anomaly did not however support a significant improvement of Saharan ecology, and summer monsoonal rains never extended this far north (30°N). Such a destructive period of extreme precipitation is novel for the Holocene record of the NE Sahara, and requires a synoptic explanation in the mid-latitude jet stream, rather than the tropical monsoonal circulation, to contradict current theoretical expectations. This anomaly was repeated on a subdued scale during the Early Middle Ages. Nile floods did not impinge upon the site during Old Kingdom times, but were demonstrably higher ∼700 BCE, and again during Early Roman or Coptic times.Residual subdisciplinary problems are identified and explicitly discussed in terms of the strategies and structure of multidisciplinary investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Flash flood destruction; Interdisciplinary research collaboration; Mudbrick meltdown; Nile flood variability; Potential for environmental and urban histories; Saharan climatic anomalies","alluvial fan; anomaly; archaeology; collapse; desert; environmental history; erosion; flash flood; floodplain; Holocene; interdisciplinary approach; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); urban history; urban site; weathering; World Heritage Site; Egypt; Giza [Egypt]; Sahara",,,03054403,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878358484

Data from the Human Mortality Database were used and vital statistics from England and Wales are used for illustration. The simpler of these methods involves coplotting mean age of death with its variance, and the more complex of these methods is to present data as a contour plot. The coplot method shows the effect of the 20th century's epidemiological transitions. The contour plot method allows more complex and subtle age, period and cohort effects to be seen. The contour plot shows the effects of broad improvements in public health over the 20th century, including vast reductions in rates of childhood mortality, reduced baseline mortality risks during adulthood and the postponement of higher mortality risks to older ages. They also show the effects of the two world wars and the 1918 influenza pandemic on men of fighting age, women and children. The contour plots also show a cohort effect for people born around 1918, suggesting a possible epigenetic effect of parental exposure to the pandemic which shortened the cohort's lifespan and which has so far received little attention.

As the field of global surgery continues to gain momentum in academic centers throughout the world, the role of the surgical subspecialist in the public health infrastructure of low-resource communities has also begun to gain a new sense of wonder and importance. Arthur Barsky, Jr was arguably one of the most influential forefathers of global plastic surgery. Throughout his notable career spanning most of the 20th century, Barsky remained dedicated to delivering plastic and reconstructive surgical care to the disadvantaged worldwide, as well as educating others to do the same. Although he was not the first surgeon with an interest in global health, Barsky's work was unique and influential in its originality, magnitude, and scope. An appreciation and understanding of Barsky's groundbreaking work will help inform the future development of sustainable surgical systems in resource-poor settings.

Design Multicenter intervention study with pre-post design. Setting Twelve Dutch hospitals. Participants One thousand five hundred forty-three individuals aged 65 and older with an acute hospital admission through the emergency department. Measurements The intervention consisted of the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH), based on combining information from the community pharmacy record, the information provided by a structured interview with participants about their medication use, and medication containers. In nine hospitals, pharmacy technicians obtained the BPMH, and in three hospitals, a mixed model was used (physicians or pharmacy technicians obtained the BPMH). Primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants with one or more unintentional medication discrepancies. The primary outcome measure was stratified according to type of intervention (pharmacy based vs mixed model). Results The proportion of participants with one or more unintentional medication discrepancies was reduced from 62% to 32% [odds ratio (OR) = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.37]. These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for type of department and hospital (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.15-0.26), and this effect remained stable for 6 months. Stratified analysis showed that no effect from the intervention was evident in the three hospitals with a mixed-model intervention, in contrast to the hospitals with a pharmacy-based intervention. The medication discrepancy types ""omission"" and ""dosage or strength"" occurred most frequently and were the main types that the intervention influenced.

Although measles was (and remains) a killer disease in the developing world, in the United States and Western Europe this was no longer so. Many parents and many medical practitioners considered measles an inevitable stage of a child's development. Debating the desirability of measles immunization, public health experts reasoned differently. In the United States, introduction of the vaccine fit well with Kennedy's and Johnson's administrations' political commitments. European policymakers proceeded cautiously, concerned about the acceptability of existing vaccination programs. In Sweden and the Netherlands, recent experience in controlling polio led researchers to prefer an inactivated virus vaccine. Although in the early 1970s attempts to develop a sufficiently potent inactivated vaccine were abandoned, we have argued that the debates and initiatives of the time during the vaccine's early history merit reflection in today's era of standardization and global markets. © 2013 American Journal of Public Health.",,"measles mumps rubella vaccine; measles vaccine; article; health; history; human; measles; History, 20th Century; Humans; Measles; Measles Vaccine; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; World Health",,,00900036,,AJPEA,23763422,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880143281

Research Design and Methods: We recruited age- and sex-matched individuals with physician-diagnosed T1DM (n=70) and T2DM (n=72). All were 12-27 years of age with a duration of diabetes of >2 years, at a large tertiary-care diabetes center in Chennai, southern India. Age- and sex-matched individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n=68) were selected from an ongoing population study. NGT was defined using World Health Organization criteria. Serum total adiponectin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify adiponectin cut points for discriminating T1DM from T2DM. Results: Adiponectin levels were higher in T1DM and lower in T2DM compared with the NGT group (9.89, 3.88, and 6.84 μg/mL, respectively; P<0.001). In standardized polytomous regression models, adiponectin was associated with T1DM (odds ratio [OR]=1.131 per SD; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.025-1.249) and T2DM (OR=0.628 per SD; 95% CI, 0.504-0.721) controlled for age, gender, waist circumference, body mass index, hypertension, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, serum triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, family history of T2DM, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Using ROC analysis, an adiponectin cut point of 5.1 μg/mL had a C statistic of 0.886 (95% CI, 0.836-0.953), sensitivity of 80.6%, and specificity of 80.6% to differentiate T1DM from T2DM. Using the 5.1 μg/mL cut point, 80.6% of T1DM and 81.8% of T2DM would be correctly classified.

To make this indelibly clear, in surgical anatomic and clinical lectures given during the past 20 years, I have chosen to present the earliest Biblical examples of the ancient's knowledge of this critical relationship as regards wounds of the thorax specifically given to injure the liver and thus to produce a rapid and certain death. The first two concern the technique of assassination used by the warring factions of the House of King Saul and the followers of the House of David, which resulted in his succeeding to the kingship of Israel after the death of King Saul in the 10th century BC. The second example is the coup de grâce administered in 30 AD to the crucified Jesus by a Roman centurion to hasten His death. In all three cases, the evidence, in the first two cases explicit and in the third strongly implied, is that the executioners knew that a stab wound of the lower thorax on the right would lead to a rapid death by exsanguination because ""the liver was suspended there."" The importance of this understanding, made indelible by these examples discussed herein, is to insure the recognition by any medical student or surgical resident that any penetrating wound of the lower thorax may imply a much more serious injury to an intra-abdominal organ, and this must be rapidly and fully investigated.

By interpreting results from population genomics studies that trace mutation processes over centuries of human activities, lay-representations of IBD often consider them historical evidence. The perceived spread of IBD in Oman may thus provide unusual historical depth in a country where past conflicts have been erased from historiography and representations of time are politically prescribed. Through the notions of crisis and diversification, this contribution shows how IBD's chronicity challenges the healthcare system and became a national issue, politically labelled as urgent. The paper casts light on several aspects of contemporary Omani society: it first addresses the dynamics of disease taxonomies-although biomedically described in the early twentieth century, IBD were not individualized within local nosologies until the 1970s. Secondly, it shows how biomedical knowledge about IBD led to diversification within the healthcare system, through the introduction of clinical genetics, genomics, and community genetics. Thirdly, it attempts to broach modalities of the biopower exerted by the Omani regime over its citizens: IBD are targeted by various public health measures that jeopardize patients autonomy by aiming to control their bodies through their matrimonial behaviour. In addition, two aspects of the intersections between Omani social hierarchy and IBD are noteworthy: the creation of a patients association that constitutes a potential disturbance of the social order; and the way IBD mutations traced by genomics are considered direct historical documents that challenge representations of the recently crafted Omanity in a context of regional concern regarding national identities durability. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","biopolitics; biosociality; genetics; inherited blood disorders; Middle-East","article; beta thalassemia; biomedicine; blood transfusion; chronicity; clinical genetics; disease classification; ethnographic research; follow up; genetic counseling; genetic disorder; genetic screening; genomics; health care system; health education; hematologic disease; history; human; human activities; hygiene; incidence; infant mortality; inherited blood disorder; leadership; life expectancy; marriage; newborn screening; Oman; patient autonomy; patient care; prenatal diagnosis; prevalence; priority journal; public health; sickle cell anemia; social background; social dominance; world health organization; Anemia, Sickle Cell; beta-Thalassemia; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Oman; Public Health; Social Control, Formal",,,13648470,,APMDF,23898837,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882364830

It establishes the political and biographical contexts for Heaney's reception of Milosz's prose and poetry, and discusses the importance of Milosz's Nobel Lecture and his memoir, Native Realm, in fostering Heaney's feelings of affinity and sense of difference. Composed in the wake of Solidarity's challenge to the post-war status quo, Milosz's reflections in the Nobel Lecture on history, art, and the artist's responsibilities had a profound resonance for his fellow exile, uncertain as he was how to address the Hunger Strikes in the collection he was working on, Station Island. The essay thus explores the range of factors which resulted in Milosz becoming The Master to Heaney, and ends offering an analysis of his poem of that title. It draws on a range of literary and historical sources, including the Heaney archives at Emory, Atlanta. Since it is the centenary of Milosz's birth, it offers a timely reminder of his importance in world literature.

Yet, this troubled and stigmatised focal point of populist media representations and government policy does not reflect the diversity of urban Aboriginal life in inner Sydney. This paper draws on a range of sources about living in Redfern, from the difficult politics of establishing and retaining an Aboriginal urban space and place in the contemporary gentrifying city - achieved in large part through the establishment of now long-standing service provision - through to the rise of alternate visions and lives and many more 'ordinary' ways of living in the city.

Methods: The cross-sectional study included all individuals, 15 years and above, in a rural unit of Calicut District in North Kerala. Data were collected using the validated World Health Organization - International League of Associations for Rheumatology - Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases - Bhigwan model questionnaire by trained volunteers. In Phase 1 details of demographic characteristics, major co-morbidities and perceived musculoskeletal aches and pains were elicited. Phases 2 and 3 further evaluated and diagnosed the subjects. Predictors for RMSD were assessed using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: There were 4999 individuals in the study. The prevalence of RMSD was 24.9% (95% CI 23.73; 26.12%). Females constituted 50.7% of the population; 5.1% of the respondents were illiterate; 80.9% belonged to low-income groups. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension affected 4.1% and 5.4% of the subjects respectively. The predictors for RMSD in the population were female sex, age, illiteracy, married status, low-income group, vegetarian diet, current alcohol consumption, current tobacco use, history of injury or accidents, diabetes and hypertension. Symptom-related ill-defined rheumatism (10.39%) followed by osteoarthritis (3.85%) were the most prevalent in the Phase 3 rheumatological evaluation. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to introduce lifestyle modifications in high-risk groups and start rehabilitation for those affected.

Accordingly, management decisions have largely been left up to the individual treating physician and guidelines are based on 'good practice' and theory rather than level 1, grade A evidence. Substantial progress has been made in recent years, particularly in the field of hemorrhagic stroke, where recently presented and soon to completed large-scale trials may finally give us a firm evidence base. For ischemic stroke, many important studies have informed our understanding of the basic pathophysiology, epidemiology, treatment and outcomes of BP management in acute stroke and, although not yet constituting a solid 'evidence base', are helping us from the 'cognitive quick-sand' of small studies and personal experiences. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.","β-blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; blood pressure; calcium channel antagonists; hemorrhagic stroke; hypertension; hypotension; ischemic stroke","atenolol; bendroflumethiazide; candesartan; enalapril; eprosartan; glyceryl trinitrate; hydralazine; indapamide; infusion fluid; labetalol; lisinopril; losartan; nicardipine; nimodipine; nitrendipine; nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; nitroprusside sodium; perindopril; phenylephrine; placebo; ramipril; telmisartan; antihypertensive therapy; blood clot lysis; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; brain blood flow; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; brain perfusion; cardiovascular autoregulation; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; diuretic therapy; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug induced headache; drug safety; human; hypertension; hypotension; intracranial pressure; medical history; meta analysis (topic); morbidity; multicenter study (topic); nonhuman; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); renin angiotensin aldosterone system; review; secondary prevention; side effect; stroke patient; subarachnoid hemorrhage; treatment outcome; unspecified side effect; world health organization; Blood Pressure; Humans; Hypertension; Hypotension; Stroke",,,14737175,,ERNXA,23965165,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882777396

This approach involves reassessing the significance of a specific production that is widely considered to be the first of its kind, in the broader context of related works that have appeared over a period of twenty years. The first example of this type of work is Hamnet: Shakespeare's Play Adapted for IRC (1993), an appropriation of Hamlet. This work goes beyond the act of interpreting dramatic literature through new technologies; however, some subsequent works do not seem to have built on the unique performance qualities that this work discovered in online environments, and have arguably become less innovative renditions of more conventional theatrical productions. While there is plenty of room for creativity and scope for innovation in online virtual worlds, they can also be used as a tool for simulation. © 2013 Intellect Ltd Article.","Avatar; Hamlet; Internet history; MMORPGs; Online performance; Text-based chat; Virtual worlds",,,,14794713,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882265620

In Iran, the introduction of forestry management policies in the twentieth century coincided with a period of severe depletion in forest cover. This over-utilization resulted from tree cutting for road construction, the establishment of sawmills and match factories, and in particular, the growing demand for charcoal and fuelwood for a rapidly increasing population. The formal forestry management policies initiated in the early 1900s were inadequately enforced, leading to continuing loss of forests through largely unregulated exploitation. Despite the discovery of oil in 1908 and natural gas in 1937, gas pipeline construction for domestic consumption was slow, kerosene was only gradually substituted for wood, charcoal consumption only fell steeply after 1960, and the established forest cover decreased sharply between 1970 and 1990. In 1991, the first of the post-Revolution national Five Year Development Plans commenced and environmental protection was allocated significant budgetary support. The Five Year Plans implemented substantial reductions in livestock grazing in forests and encouraged reforestation, which partly offset the continuing forest removal. Using estimates based on fuelwood consumption in Brazil and USA, the forested area in Iran in 1850 would have disappeared by 2000 without the Government intervention which provided widespread access to fossil fuels. This energy-source shift decreased local pressure on the dwindling forest resources and was reinforced by Government policies to conserve and extend forests. © 2013 The Authors.

One of the activities might have determined its role: based on its relationship to the International Committee of the Red Cross, wounded multinational prisoners-of-war were interned in Swiss hospitals and Swiss physicians worked in a medical capacity in military hospitals on both sides of the front. Questions/purposes: The main question is whether the activities of the Swiss authorities reflected a charitable diplomatic role while retaining the country's traditional neutral stance. Supplementary practical questions included: How did Switzerland carry out the exchange of severely wounded prisoners of war? How did Swiss physicians function in the war zones? What were the medical objectives and the ultimate results of wartime surgery in Switzerland? Methods: This study is based on archival material from the Swiss Federal Archive in Bern (BAR) and original publications of Swiss and German physicians in professional journals. The search was performed manually in the BAR evaluating the file ""Landesverteidigung (national defense)"" from 1848 to 2009. Original publications and journals were searched manually in the central libraries of Munich, Heidelberg, Zurich, and Bern. Results: The evaluation of Swiss diplomatic activities confirmed that Switzerland's charitable mission was aimed to enforce its neutral position and that Swiss authorities were able to efficiently manage the resulting problems. The engagement of Swiss surgeons in war surgery contributed to their experience and knowledge and yielded the development of many innovative medical devices and operating procedures, numerous of which are still known today. Conclusion: While maintaining its neutral position, Switzerland was able to deal with the practical problems while gaining innovative medical knowledge still valid today. © 2013 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®.",,"bone graft; fracture treatment; human; joint fracture; medical care; medical practice; military medicine; physician attitude; priority journal; prisoner; professional knowledge; pseudarthrosis; review; social welfare; soft tissue injury; surgical technique; Switzerland; war; work experience; wound care; Cooperative Behavior; Diffusion of Innovation; General Surgery; History, 20th Century; Hospitals, Military; Humans; International Cooperation; Military Medicine; Paintings; Prisoners; Red Cross; Switzerland; World War I",,,0009921X,,CORTB,23649223,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880260485

For soldiers of the British, American, and Dominion armies, live entertainment, most typically concert parties, was an integral part of their experiences of the First World War. Yet we know very little about what these experiences were, or what entertainment meant to soldiers. This article examines the experience of live entertainment for Australian soldiers in the First World War. Firstly, it explores entertainment organized for the first AIF, focusing on the soldier concert party. Secondly, it attempts to ascertain some of the responses of soldier-audiences to this entertainment by looking at evidence left by members of those audiences such as that recorded in letters and diaries. It also examines soldier-entertainment and audience experiences in order to reveal something about soldiers' interaction with popular culture, as well as the trench culture shared by soldiers. © W.

Earlier studies have shown a crosscultural consensus on historical events that are considered to be important. It has been indicated that a strong Western-Christian European template dominates the view of which events are considered to be important events in history, by many samples across the world. It was the aim of this study to test this finding with a Turkish sample, which would represent some unique characteristics in that it is Muslim, comes from an Empire background, and has undergone a recent nation-building process. College students (n = 372) responded to a questionnaire that was utilized in seven other countries. It was shown that Turkish students were not Eurocentric as expected by the literature: They were highly sociocentric; they gave importance to events related to Turkish history. They were similar to their European counterparts in that war and violence were given primary importance when selecting events as important in history. However, they did not behave as predicted by earlier literature: They did not see Western European events as having a primary importance in history but gave at least equal importance to events that originated from Ottoman Empire roots. The results were discussed in terms of the unique cultural and historical variables that contribute to the identity and social psychological attributions of Turkish students. Further research should focus on not only which events are considered as important historical events but also the reasons behind these. © 2013 Copyright International Union of Psychological Science.","Cultural differences; Historical events; Social perception; Turkish","adult; article; consensus; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; Europe; female; history; human; male; psychological aspect; religion; statistics; student; Turkey (republic); violence; war; young adult; Adult; Christianity; Consensus; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cultural Characteristics; Europe; Female; History; Humans; Islam; Male; Students; Turkey; Violence; War; Western World; Young Adult",,,00207594,,,22827603,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881601421

In 2012, there were 542 cases of Guinea worm reported globally, of which 521 (96.1%) were reported in South Sudan. Protracted civil wars, an inadequate workforce, neglect of potable water provision programs, suboptimal Guinea worm surveillance and case containment, and fragmented health systems account for many of the structural and operational factors encumbering South Sudan's Guinea worm eradication efforts. This article reviews the impacts of six established Guinea worm control strategies in South Sudan: (1) surveillance to determine actual caseload distribution and trends in response to control measures; (2) educating community members from whom worms are emerging to avoid immersing affected parts in sources of drinking water; (3) filtering potentially contaminated drinking water using cloth filters or filtered drinking straws; (4) treating potentially contaminated surface water with the copepod larvicide temephos (Abate); (5) providing safe drinking water from boreholes or hand-dug wells; and (6) containment of transmission through voluntary isolation of each patient to prevent contamination of drinking water sources, provision of first aid, and manual extraction of the worm. Surveillance, community education, potable water provision, and case containment remain weak facets of the program. Abate pesticide is not a viable option for Guinea worm control in South Sudan. In light of current case detection and containment trends, as well as capacity building efforts for Guinea worm eradication, South Sudan is more likely to eradicate Guinea worm by 2020, rather than by 2015. The author highlights areas in which substantial improvements are required in South Sudan's Guinea worm eradication program, and suggests improvement strategies. © 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases.","Eradication program components; Guinea worm; South sudan","drinking water; disease eradication; disease transmission; dracunculiasis; Dracunculus medinensis; endemic disease; filtration; health care system; health education; human; patient education; review; Sudan; water contamination; Animals; Communicable Disease Control; Dracunculiasis; Dracunculus Nematode; Geography, Medical; Health Education; History, 21st Century; Humans; Public Health Surveillance; Sudan; Water Supply; World Health",,,12019712,,IJIDF,23623648,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891372529

Barkan, is a trial revolving around highly publicized legal controversies. In some cases, such a trial may determine fundamental political questions, exceeding the legal realm, which are in debate inside a given polity. The 1957-58 trial related to the 1956 massacre in Kafr Qasim, Israel certainly belongs to this category. The trial established the doctrine of a ""manifestly unlawful order"" in Israeli military law, contributed considerably to the reshaping of civil-military relations, and influenced the civic status of the Arab minority in Israel. In this article, using hitherto underexamined primary sources, I argue that the most important contribution of the trial, the doctrine of a ""manifestly unlawful order"", was not only a creation of the bench but also a result of a complicated interaction between the actors present in the courtroom: the defendants, their defense lawyers, the prosecutors, and the judges. Above all, the article shows how the bitter struggle between the two main attorneys helped shape the doctrine of a ""manifestly unlawful order"", that is, an order that is illegal for a soldier to obey.

To meet the standards defined in these guidelines, the current evaluation methodology at WHO must be an evidence-based assessment. Methods: We describe the history of substance evaluation from 1912 to the present and the development of the evaluation methods over time including a description of the current assessment system, using reports from WHO and its predecessor, the League of Nations. Furthermore, we describe the current review system. Results: We found that some substances under international control were never reviewed; other substances were reviewed decades ago. Conclusions: We argue that assessments do not have unlimited validity, and therefore, substances need to be re-assessed periodically, as already recommended by the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence in 1982. We propose that the evaluation time be shortened; that the influence of the route of administration and/or dosage form of the preparation is considered in the evaluation; and we recommend studying national and regional assessment systems and adopting their best practices.

Methods: Upon pathological diagnosis, some of the 193 cases of BAC or adenocarcinoma with BAC features were categorized into adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), based on the 2011 WHO classification. Gender, age, tumor size, familial cancer history, smoking history, TNM stage, symptoms, duration of symptoms, and the choice of treatment were recorded and analyzed for prognosis. The survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was introduced to compare the survival rate. Univariate and multivariate factors for the survival rate were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 84.3%, 60.6%, and 45.6%, respectively. Cox univariate analysis revealed that the tumor size, symptoms, TNM stage, pathological outcomes, and the choice of treatment were all prognostic factors. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that TNM stage was an independent prognostic factor for patients with BAC. Data from patients with AIS and MIA revealed better survival. Conclusion: The overall survival rate of BAC and adenocarcinoma with BAC features are superior to that of other non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The clinical symptoms are non-specific compared with other types of NSCLC. Clinical stage at diagnosis is a key prognostic factor, such that early correct diagnosis significantly improves survival. The new classification criteria of WHO, released in 2011, is more elaborate and more conducive to clinical practice.","Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma; Clinical features; prognosis; Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)","adenocarcinoma; adenocarcinoma in situ; article; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; family history; histopathology; human; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; lung alveolus cell carcinoma; lung non small cell cancer; major clinical study; minimally invasive adenocarcinoma; overall survival; smoking; survival rate; world health organization",,,10008179,,ZZLIE,,"Chinese",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885127525

The slogan was "" Combat Drug Resistance - No action today, no cure tomorrow"" A six-point policy package was launched as a core product for World Health Day. It aimed to stimulate extensive and coherent action to overcome the many challenges presented by antimicrobial resistance.Methods: As a preparation for World Health Day, interviews were conducted with a series of key informants, mainly senior government staff, to assess their awareness of the topic and the interventions proposed in the policy package. Since the key informant interview methodology was used with a small number of interviewees, it may be difficult to demonstrate the validity of the findings.Results: Key informants from twelve out of fifteen countries responded, which included Fiji (n = 5), Kiribati (n = 1), Lao PDR (n = 2), Malaysia (n = 6), Micronesia (n = 3), Mongolia (n = 5), the Philippines (n = 5), Vietnam (n = 6), Vanuatu (n = 1), Solomon Islands (n = 3), Cambodia (n = 5) and Brunei (n = 1). There was a total of forty-three respondents (n = 43). AMR was widely recognized as a problem. Lack of a coherent, comprehensive and national plan or strategy was noted. Surveillance was often seen as weak and fragmented even where presented. Laboratory capacity was felt to be insufficient across all countries interviewed. The majority of respondents stressed the need for national and local plans to combat AMR including reliable estimates of the financial cost of combating and managing AMR, the need for legislation to control inappropriate use of antimicrobials in food animals and more serious efforts to promote Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) and Rational Prescription. Also, importance was highlighted of the need to include infection prevention and control (IPC) as a part of accreditation and registration of health institutions and programs to promote IPC to the general population.Conclusion: A coalition of interested parties at the local, national and international levels need to generate and sustain the political will to organize a more comprehensive, sustainable, and coherent approach to AMR. © 2013 Lee and Wakabayashi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR); Key informant interview (KII); Western pacific region; World health day; World health organization (WHO)","antiinfective agent; antimicrobial activity; health care; public health; sustainable development; World Health Organization; animal; antibiotic resistance; article; awareness; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; cost; drug misuse; Federated States of Micronesia; Fiji; food; government; health care facility; health program; human; infection control; infection prevention; interview; key informant interview; Kiribati; Laos; law; Malaysia; methodology; Mongolia; Philippines; practice guideline; priority journal; Solomon Islands; validity; Vanuatu; Viet Nam; health; history; Pacific islands; qualitative research; Southeast Asia; world health organization; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Anniversaries and Special Events; Asia, Southeastern; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Humans; Mongolia; Pacific Islands; Qualitative Research; World Health; World Health Organization",,,17448603,,,23889997,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880887560

Churchill was aware that Biggart's service would be responsible for the needs of the Allied Forces and later for the United States Forces in Northern Ireland. Professor J.H. Biggart was known to Churchill from their 1926 post-prandial encounter in Belfast. The United States in 1941 determined that they were not able or prepared to fly U.S.-donated blood to Europe or Africa. The shortage of whole blood for United States forces required Whitby's ABTS to supply all the blood for the Mediterranean Theatre and in Europe from the St. Lô breakout from Normandy until after the capture of Brussels on September 3, 1944 and then again in December 1944 for the Battle of the Bulge. Winston S. Churchill took Whitby to Quebec in September 1944 to meet with President Roosevelt and the combined U.S. Chiefs of Staff. Churchill used the supply of British blood to meet the needs of American Forces to prevent the U.S. threats to bankrupt the British Empire. President Roosevelt, already involved in his fourth campaign for the U.S. Presidency, accepted most of the British proposals for further credits. By Okinawa in the spring of 1945, under ABTS tutelage, all the Allies were adept in long-range transport and storage of large, 100,000 pint quantities of whole blood. Subsequently, Whitby and John Henry Biggart were knighted; U.S. Army Surgeon General Magee was sacked. © The Ulster Medical Society, 2013.",,"article; battle injury; blood bank; blood donor; blood storage; burn; emergency health service; human; military medicine; plasma transfusion; professional knowledge; strategic planning; war; Blood Banks; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Personnel; United States; World War II",,,00416193,,UMJOA,24082291,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879430945

Transition theories portrayed health improvements as part of an overall development pattern based on economic growth as modeled by the recent history of industrialization in high-income countries. In the 1970s, an increasing awareness of the environmental degradation caused by industrialization challenged the conventional model of development. Gradually, it became clear that health improvements depended on poverty-reduction strategies including industrialization. Industrialization, in turn, risked aggravating environmental degradation with its negative effects on public health. Thus, public health in low-income countries threatened to suffer from lack of economic development as well as from the results of global economic development. Similarly, demands of developing countries risked being trapped between calls for global wealth redistribution, a political impossibility, and calls for unrestricted material development, which, in a world of finite land, water, air, energy, and resources, increasingly looked like a physical impossibility, too.Various international bodies, including the WHO, the Brundtland Commission, and the World Bank, tried to capture the problem and solution strategies in development theories. Broadly conceived, two models have emerged: a ""localist model,"" which analyzes national health data and advocates growth policies with a strong focus on poverty reduction, and a ""globalist"" model, based on global health data, which calls for growth optimization, rather than maximization. Both models have focused on different types of health burdens and have received support from different institutions. In a nutshell, the health discourse epitomized a larger controversy regarding competing visions of development. © 2012 The Author.","Brundtland Commission; development; global health; transition theories; World Bank; World Health Organization","article; Brundtland Commission; development; economic development; global health; health; history; human; industry; poverty; transition theories; United Nations; World Bank; world health organization; Brundtland Commission; development; global health; transition theories; World Bank; World Health Organization; Economic Development; History, 20th Century; Humans; Industry; Poverty; United Nations; World Health; World Health Organization",,,00225045,,JHMAA,22467707,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880246641

Epigenetic changes may reflect childhood adversities, while their effects on clinical characteristics of depression are unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether epigenetic changes were associated with childhood adversities, pretreatment characteristics, and treatment outcomes in depressive patients. In 108 patients with major depressive disorders, the methylation status in the promoter of gene encoding serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) was measured. Childhood adversities, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics including assessment scales for depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HAMD), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, HAMA), functioning (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, SOFAS), disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule-12, WHODAS-12), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life-Abbreviated form, WHOQOL-BREF) were evaluated at baseline. After a 12-week treatment with antidepressants, the assessment scales were reevaluated. To avoid type I error by multiple comparisons, Bonferroni corrections were applied. Higher SLC6A4 promoter methylation status was significantly associated with childhood adversities, worse clinical presentation (family history of depression, higher perceived stress, and more severe psychopathology assessed by SOFAS, WHODAS-12, and WHOQOL-BREF), but was not associated with treatment outcomes after considering multiple comparisons.

In the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, anti-retroviral drug resistance results from insufficient anti-retroviral pressure, which may lead to treatment failure. Preliminary studies support the idea that anti-retroviral drug resistance has evolved largely as a result of low-adherence of patients to therapy and extensive use of anti-retroviral drugs in the developed world; however, a highly heterogeneous horde of viral quasi-species are currently circulating in developing nations. Thus, the prioritizing of strategies adopted in such two worlds should be quite different considering the varying anti-retroviral drug resistance prevalence.

These subtle signs have been interpreted as evidence of an impending public health catastrophe. This article traces the history of research on coronary heart disease decline and resurgence and situates it in broader narratives of public health catastrophism. Juxtaposing the coronary heart disease literature alongside the narratives of emerging and reemerging infectious disease helps to identify patterns in how public health researchers create data and craft them into powerful narratives of progress or pessimism.

This declaration followed the successful completion of the WHO's Malaria Eradication Programme (MEP) on the island, initiated in 1958. This account first explores the antecedent control measures adopted by the government up to the MEP. These, as advocated by the previous malaria 'experts' who had reported on the disease on the island concentrated on controlling the vector and the administration of quinine for individual protection. Although Jamaica suffered no catastrophic epidemics of island-wide scope, malaria was a constant cause of mortality and morbidity. Major change came in the wake of the Second World War within the changing political context of national independence and international development. In 1957 the Jamaican government joined the global WHO programme to eradicate malaria. The Jamaican campaign exposes many of the problems noted in other studies of such top-down initiatives in their lack of attention to the particular circumstances of each case. Despite being described as 'a textbook pattern' of malaria eradication, the MEP in Jamaica suffered from a lack of sufficient preparation and field knowledge. This is most obviously illustrated by the fact that all literature on the programme sent to Jamaica in the first two years was in Spanish. That the MEP exploited the technological opportunity provided by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) with advantage in Jamaica is not disputed but as this analysis illustrates this success was by no means guaranteed.

Interestingly, a couple of decades later, Linnaeus showed very little excitement in reviewing this debate, and this although he was the first to introduce the terminological distinction of artificial vs. natural methods. In this paper, I will explain Linnaeus's indifference by the fact that earlier debates were revolving around problems of plant diagnosis rather than classification. From Linnaeus's perspective, they were therefore concerned with what he called artificial methods alone - diagnostic tools, that is, which were artificial no matter which characters were taken into account. The natural method Linnaeus proposed, on the other hand, was not about diagnosis, but about relations of equivalence which played a vital, although largely implicit role in the practices of specimen exchange on which naturalists relied to acquire knowledge of the natural world. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,"Diagnostic tools; Natural world; Biographies; History; Knowledge management",,,00033790,,ANNSA,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885019246

The study shows that during most of the era of collaboration, spanning the period of mid-1970s-2011, Libya's relations with Turkey constituted an exceptional 'island' of pragmatism in Libya's ocean of fanatically and ideologically driven foreign relations. Often plagued by Qaddafi's tumultuous political and ideological whims, as a result of which he often entangled his country in military adventures and conflicts, the study explores the unique nature of Tripoli-Ankara ties, notwithstanding Turkey's Western orientation and amicable links with Israel (at least during the major part of the period reviewed) - both perceived by Qaddafi as pure evil. Tripoli carefully navigated its ties with Ankara, with the exception of the crisis Qaddafi provoked in 1996 when he let his staunchly ideological support of the Kurdish cause eclipse and shake the rational Libyan-Turkish relations. Examining this set of bilateral ties mainly through a Libyan prism, the article also sheds light on the major Turkish crossroads on the bilateral track. Tracing these relations, which flourished mainly within an economic context, the discussion takes into account the two countries' domestic affairs as well as their wider regional and international environs - all of which impacted the convergence or conflict of interests.

We determined the frequency distribution of dental caries. Chemical analyses were concerned with the presence of elements such as strontium, barium, calcium and stable carbon isotopes (13C/ 14C). We chose three consecutive periods: Late Roman (2nd-4th century AD), Islamic (600-1200 AD) and Modern Islamic (1850-1950 AD). Materials and methods: We analysed the dental remains of 145 individuals, with a total of 2530 teeth. We used visual research (magnifying glass/sharp dental probe) and radiography. The frequencies of caries were calculated on the basis of the proportional correction factor of Erdal and Duyar. We chose 39 permanent second molars for chemical analyses. Results: The frequency of carious lesions was similar in all three periods (6-8%). In the Modern Islamic and Islamic periods, occlusal surfaces were infected with caries most often, while the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and approximal surfaces were affected to a lesser degree. However, in the Late Roman period, the CEJ and approximal surfaces showed caries most frequently, in contrast to occlusal surfaces, which seldom showed signs of caries. Chemical analyses showed lower Sr/Ca ratios and Observed Ratio index values for the Modern Islamic and higher values for the Islamic and Late Roman periods. Mean stable isotope (δ13C) analyses demonstrated that the Modern Islamic period was strongly divergent from the other periods. Discussion: These data suggest a similar socio-economic status during the Late Roman and Islamic periods. The diet of the population living in the Late Roman and Islamic periods contained a larger number of products containing strontium than calcium. In the modern population these proportions have been reversed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent literature has analyzed the significance of this research for the rise of conservative physical anthropology. Taking a complementary approach, the essay charts new territory in seeking to understand how the prison-camp studies informed philology and linguistics specifically. I argue that recognizing philological commitments of the Phonographic Commission is essential to comprehending the project contextually. My approach reveals that linguists accommodated material and contemporary evidence to older text-based research models, sustaining dynamic theories of language. Through a case study based on the Iranian philologist F. C.

While the scholars who fostered the postcolonial approach, in dealing with modern science in the non-West, espoused an idealist vision, they nevertheless stressed its political and ideological underpinnings and engaged with the question of its putative Western roots. The postidealist history of science developed its own vision with respect to the question of the global spread of modern science, paying little heed to postcolonial debates. It then proposes a historiographical approach developed in large part by historians of South Asian politics, economics, and science that, without compromising the preoccupations of each of the two groups, could help construct a mutually comprehensible and connected framework for the understanding of the global workings of the sciences. © 2013 by The History of Science Society All rights reserved.",,"article; Asia; cultural anthropology; history; human; India; knowledge; learning; political system; politics; science; Asia; Colonialism; Historiography; History, 20th Century; Humans; India; Knowledge; Learning; Politics; Science; Western World",,,00211753,,,23961692,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879598148

Their respective legacies have been subject to equally contrasting evaluations in modern times: Rivers is heralded as a 'founding father' in psychotherapy; his methods celebrated for their compassion and humanity, while Yealland's techniques have found closer comparison with torture and sadistic experimentation. This paper argues that judgments of these two physicians are guilty of oversight, and consequently, in Yealland's case particularly, warrant a more nuanced assessment. Besides the miles of destroyed countryside, maimed bodies, and interminable bloodshed, the horrors of trench warfare gave rise to a new kind of malady. It chose no sides, but in all cases, having suffered no discernible physical injury, soldiers succumbed to a variety of debilitating and yet mysterious behaviours: shrieking fits, paralysis, blindness or muteness, to name but a few. This neurosis decimated the soldier's ability to function, let alone fight, and the victims began to congest military hospitals, puzzling doctors more accustomed to dealing with conventional battle field casualties. Charles Myers, a British psychologist, ascribed the symptoms to extreme mental stress, utilising a term already familiar to men in the trenches: 'shell shock'.",,"Combat Disorders; history; human; military medicine; public hospital; soldier; war; Combat Disorders; History, 20th Century; Hospitals, Military; Humans; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; World War I",,,13734857,,,26050282,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936111810

Analyses of large longitudinal studies with a sufficient number of incident cases and in which the time-dependent processes of both excess weight and asthma development can be validly analyzed are lacking. Objective: We sought to investigate whether the course of BMI predicts incident asthma in childhood. Methods: Data from 12,050 subjects of 8 European birth cohorts on asthma and allergies were combined. BMI and doctor-diagnosed asthma were modeled during the first 6 years of life with latent growth mixture modeling and discrete time hazard models. Subpopulations of children were identified with similar standardized BMI trajectories according to age- and sex-specific ""World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards"" and ""WHO growth standards for school aged children and adolescents"" for children up to age 5 years and older than 5 years, respectively (BMI-SDS). These types of growth profiles were analyzed as predictors for incident asthma. Results: Children with a rapid BMI-SDS gain in the first 2 years of life had a higher risk for incident asthma up to age 6 years than children with a less pronounced weight gain slope in early childhood. The hazard ratio was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.5) after adjustment for birth weight, weight-for-length at birth, gestational age, sex, maternal smoking in pregnancy, breast-feeding, and family history of asthma or allergies. A rapid BMI gain at 2 to 6 years of age in addition to rapid gain in the first 2 years of life did not significantly enhance the risk of asthma. Conclusion: Rapid growth in BMI during the first 2 years of life increases the risk of asthma up to age 6 years. © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","asthma; Body mass index; child; European birth cohorts; Global Allergy and Asthma European Network; latent growth mixture model; rapid growth","allergy; article; asthma; birth weight; body mass; breast feeding; child; child growth; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; family history; female; gestational age; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; maternal smoking; predictive value; preschool child; priority journal; risk assessment; standard; weight gain; world health organization; Asthma; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Obesity; Risk Factors",,,00916749,,JACIB,23403049,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878600839

For several decades, a steady increase in prevalence has been observed worldwide. In the structural collaboration between the Centre for Population Health Services in Edinburgh and the Research Institute CAPHRI of Maastricht we investigated the possibilities for primary prevention of asthma in childhood. We found that a multifaceted approach might be effective in delaying or preventing asthma, whereas a mono-intervention does not seem to have such a protective effect. The most likely explanation is that the development of a multifactorial disease, such as asthma, is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent by eliminating only one risk factor. Underdiagnosis of asthma is still a big problem in primary care. Most patients do not present bronchial symptoms to the general practitioner, even though they have decreased lung function, so they remain unknown and undiagnosed. However, patients who do present with respiratory problems and who have reduced lung function are not always recognised as such. We found that the perception of dyspnoea seems to determine, at least in part, the presentation to the general practitioner with symptoms. These observations show that both the prevention of the development of asthma in early childhood, as well as case finding of asthma in adulthood, do not seem to be very effective in primary care. More research is needed to clarify what steps can be taken to reduce the global burden from asthma.","Asthma; Case finding; Diagnosis; Global burden; Prevalence; Prevention; Primary care; Research","bronchodilating agent; corticosteroid; adult asthma; article; asthma; breast feeding; child; Dermatophagoides; diagnostic error; disease control; drug efficacy; drug use; dyspnea; early diagnosis; family history; forced expiratory volume; genotype environment interaction; human; lung function; onset age; passive smoking; pathogenesis; primary prevention; risk factor; risk reduction; Adult; Asthma; Child; Cost of Illness; Humans; Risk Factors; World Health",,,14714418,,PCRJA,23708109,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878483114

TB has been classically associated with poverty, overcrowding and malnutrition. Low income countries and deprived areas, within big cities in developed countries, present the highest TB incidences and TB mortality rates. These are the settings where immigration, important social inequalities, HIV infection and drug or alcohol abuse may coexist, all factors strongly associated with TB. In spite of the political, economical, research and community efforts, TB remains a major global health problem worldwide. Moreover, in this new century, new challenges such as multidrug-resistance extension, migration to big cities and the new treatments with anti-tumour necrosis alpha factor for inflammatory diseases have emerged and threaten the decreasing trend in the global number of TB cases in the last years. We must also be aware about the impact that smoking and diabetes pandemics may be having on the incidence of TB. The existence of a good TB Prevention and Control Program is essential to fight against TB. The coordination among clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and others, and the link between surveillance, control and research should always be a priority for a TB Program.

We address the desire for a user to retrieve information from the Web without the search provider learning about it. Traditional PIR protocols present two main shortcomings for their application: (i) They assume cooperation by the database, which is not affordable for a real-world search engine like Google and (ii) their computational complexity is linear in the size of the database, which is unfeasible in the case of the Web. More recent approaches relax PIR conditions to overcome these limitations and present some level of privacy. Mostly, they aim to distort server logs regardless of the loss of information that is involved. Server logs are used by search engines for profiling and, thereby, provide personalized results. This becomes a user's need given the growth of the Web and can also be used for targeted advertising. This study focuses on a noncooperative agent for private search that considers profiling as valuable data used for both sides of the search process. It is based on the assumption that the user's identity is formed by the union of various areas of interests or facets. Managing the HTTP connections properly, submitted queries are mapped to different server logs according to these facets. The rationale is that these logs cannot be used for tracing the user while they are still helpful for profiling. We present a personalized query classification approach based on the user's browsing history and to provide empirical results; we developed an attacking algorithm against the agent that shows that the disclosure risk is reduced. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Browsing history; Disclosure risk; Internet search engine; Non-cooperative agents; Private information retrieval; Query classification; Search process; Targeted advertising; HTTP; Information retrieval; Internet protocols; Query processing; Search engines; World Wide Web",,,08848173,,IJISE,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876156652

Purpose The paper examines the role of education in economic growth from a theoretical and historic perspective, addresses why education has been the limiting factor determining growth, discusses why certain countries have provided education to the masses and others have not, provides estimates of the quantitative importance of the direct and the indirect effects of education on the economy, calculates the marginal national return on investment for 60 countries, and examines the implications of these results for government policy. Methodology The paper presents the results from other studies and estimates the marginal product of human capital and of physical capital and the relative importance of post-secondary education in 2005 using cross-country estimates of national income and the stocks of human capital and physical capital. The estimates of the stocks of human capital were developed from historic rates of public and private investment in schooling, the cost of capital during schooling, and students' foregone earnings. Results The paper presents evidence that education has direct and indirect effects on national output. Educated workers raise national income directly because schooling raises their marginal productivity. They raise national income indirectly by increasing the marginal productivity of physical capital and of other workers. In highly educated countries the spillover effect on other workers is minimal, but in less-educated countries the spillover effect appears to be much larger. In all countries, the positive effect of rising human capital on the productivity of physical capital is required to offset the diminishing returns to investment in physical capital and make rising investment in physical capital financially viable in the growth process. The empirical results indicate that investment in schooling is subject to diminishing returns but that the marginal return at the national level is still considerable in highly educated countries, over 10% in 2005. In the least educated countries, the marginal return is much larger, in excess of 50%, but since most of this effect is indirect, its magnitude is not generally appreciated. Achievement of these returns requires public investment in education because the direct return to the educated individual is insufficient to overcome the high cost of private financing. The results also indicate that investment in post-secondary education does not provide any additional effect on national income beyond the effect of investment in education generally. The implication is that governments may allocate their limited funds to primary and secondary schooling of the poor without suffering a loss in GDP growth. Conclusions These very high macro-marginal returns to education make it possible for poor countries to grow very rapidly if they make a major public commitment to raising the average level of schooling of the masses. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","education; financial returns; history; investment; schooling; world",,,,00131881,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879136797

This article provides an update on recent advances in the understanding of respiratory health issues in coal miners and focuses on the spectrum of disease caused by inhalation of coal mine dust, termed coal mine dust lung disease. In addition to the historical interstitial lung diseases (coal worker's pneumoconiosis, silicosis, and mixed dust pneumoconiosis), coal miners are at risk for dust-related diffuse fibrosis and chronic airway diseases, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Recent recognition of rapidly progressive pneumoconiosis in younger miners, mainly in the eastern United States, has increased the sense of urgency and the need for vigilance in medical research, clinical diagnosis, and exposure prevention. Given the risk for disease progression even after exposure removal, along with few medical treatment options, there is an important role for chest physicians in the recognition and management of lung disease associated with work in coal mining.

In sub-Saharan Africa, there is a lack of epidemiological data on the prevalence and distribution of risk factors of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors among an urban Senegalese population. Methods: Using an adaptation of the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk-factor surveillance, we conducted a population-based, cross-sectional survey from 3 to 30 May 2010 on 1 424 participants aged over 15 years. Socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors were collected in step 1. Physical anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were documented in step 2. Blood tests (cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine levels) were carried out in step 3. Results: The prevalence of hypertension was 46% (95% CI: 43.4-48%), with a higher prevalence in females (47.9%) than males (41.7%) (p = 0.015), and 50% of these hypertensive were previously undiagnosed. Mean age was 53.6 years (SD: 15.8). In known cases of hypertension, the average length of its evolution was 6 years 9 months (range 1 month to 60 years). Hypertension was significantly associated with age (p = 0.001), socio-professional category (p = 0.003), dyslipidaemia (p < 0.001), obesity (p < 0.001), physical inactivity (p < 0.001), diabetes (p < 0.001) and stroke (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors in this population.

METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2006, 984 suicide attempts were documented for patients presenting at medical institutions with a suicide attempt. RESULTS: The mean suicide attempt rate was 164/100,000 inhabitants. Women attempted suicide nearly twice as often as men. The highest suicide attempt rates were found for women aged 20-24 years, for men aged 30-34 years, and for people who were unmarried, of foreign nationality, and of low education or low employment status. 'Soft methods' were used significantly more often than 'hard methods'. Of the suicide attempt methods employed, a relatively high proportion was accounted for by self-poisoning with drugs (X60-64), especially with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Significant gender differences were found in the various methods and in the frequency of psychiatric diagnoses. A total of 98.7% of the attempters were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder according to ICD-10; 35% suffered from an affective disorder. Men were significantly more frequently affected by substance abuse disorder or psychosis, whereas in women adjustment disorders and personality disorders were diagnosed significantly more often. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers the first published representative data of an entire Swiss county. Established sociodemographic and clinical risk factors for suicide attempts were reproduced. The identification of risk factors contributes to developing local targeted prevention strategies, for example education of risk groups and caregivers, and pharmacolegal consequences for package sizes.

The majority of Christians worldwide are now found in the continents of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. But the nature of that shift and the actors involved have not been fully explored. This book maintains that a transformation of Christianity has occurred that is far more than demographical or geographical - a profound reformation in the character of Christianity itself has taken place. The emergence, growth, and impact of Pentecostalism in the past hundred years played a major role in this transformation of a European and North American religion into a non-Western, charismatic, and predominantly female one. Key figures and movements, the many divisions and proliferations, and the resourcefulness and challenges of its leaders and members in the majority world are examined. The book discusses the historical origins, characteristics, ideologies, theologies, and emphases of Pentecostalism as it developed from a small number of obscure Christian revivalist sects at the beginning of the century, to representing, in many different forms today, possibly as much as a quarter of the world's Christian population.

RTI deaths first increased in high-income countries and declined after the 1970s, and they soared in low-and middle-income countries from the 1980s onwards. As motorisation took off in North America and then spread to Europe and to the rest of the world discussions on RTIs have reflected and influenced international interpretations of the costs and benefits of 'development', as conventionally understood. Using discourse analysis, this paper explores how RTIs have been constructed in ways that have served regional and global development agendas and how 'development' has been (re-)negotiated through the discourse of RTIs and vice versa. For this purpose, this paper analyses a selection of key publications of organisations in charge of international health or transport and places them in the context of (a) the surrounding scientific discussion of the period and (b) of relevant data regarding RTI mortality, development funding, and road and other transport infrastructure. Findings suggest that constructions of RTIs have shifted from being a necessary price to be paid for development to being a sign of development at an early stage or of an insufficiently coordinated development. In recent years, RTI discussions have raised questions about development being misdirected and in need of fundamental rethinking. At present, discussions are believed to be at a crossroads between different evaluations of developmental conceptualisations for the future.© The Author 2013.

This population may play a role in driving the HIV epidemic in Uganda including the spread of transmitted drug resistance (TDR). We report data on TDR in this population among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive, recently infected individuals about 5 years after ARV scaling-up in Uganda. We identified phylogenetic transmission clusters and combined these with volunteer life histories in order to understand the sexual networks within this population. From a prospective cohort of 1,000 HIV-negative individuals recruited from five communities, 51 seroconverters were identified over a period of 2 years. From these, whole blood was collected and population sequencing of the HIV-1 pol gene (protease/reverse transcriptase) was performed from plasma. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were scored using the 2009 WHO list for surveillance of TDR. TDR prevalence categories were estimated using the WHO recommended truncated sampling technique for the surveillance of TDR for use in resource-limited settings (RLS). Of the samples 92% (47/51) were successfully genotyped. HIV-1 subtype frequencies were 15/47 (32%) A1, 20/47 (43%) D, 1/47 (2%) C, 1/47 (2%) G, and 10/47 (21%) unique recombinant forms. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug resistance mutation K103N was identified in two individuals and V106A in one (6%) suggesting that the level of TDR was moderate in this population. No nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI) DRMs were detected. In this study, we identified five transmission clusters supported by high bootstrap values and low genetic distances. Of these, one pair included the two individuals with K103N. Two of the genotypic clusters corresponded with reported sexual partnerships as detected through prior in-depth interviews. The level of TDR to NNRTIs in these ARV-naive individuals was moderate by WHO threshold survey categorization. The transmission clusters suggest a high degree of sexual partner mixing between members of these communities. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; adult; antiviral resistance; article; blood analysis; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; gene mutation; gene sequence; genotype; health survey; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; major clinical study; male; medical history; priority journal; sexual behavior; Uganda; virus transmission; world health organization; Adult; Drug Resistance, Viral; Genotype; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Prevalence; Uganda; Young Adult",,,08892229,,ARHRE,23173702,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876946491

Methods: Agendas in Committees A/B of the WHA were classified as Administrative or Technical and Health Matters. Agenda items of Health Matters were sorted into five categories by the WHO reform in the 65th WHA. The agenda items in each category and sub-category were counted. Results: There were 1647 agenda items including 423 Health Matters, which were sorted into five categories: communicable diseases (107, 25.3%), health systems (81, 19.1%), noncommunicable diseases (59, 13.9%), preparedness surveillance and response (58, 13.7%), and health through the life course (36, 8.5%). Among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, millennium development goals, influenza, and international health regulations, were discussed frequently and appeared associated with the public health milestones, but maternal and child health were discussed three times. The number of the agenda items differed for each Director-General's term of office. Conclusions: The WHA agendas cover a variety of items, but not always reflect international health issues in terms of disease burden.

Noting the change in the courtyard's formerly hegemonic position on daily trajectories illustrates both Harvey's and Lefebvre's suggestions for uncovering the way that spaces articulate social values. A particularly revealing case study occurs in the struggle over including courtyards in a Chinese developer's project for a new multi-use district outside St. Petersburg. A brief history of the courtyard in Soviet planning allows subsequent analysis of the ways in which the city administration, the Chinese design team, and Russian planners deployed the courtyard as a spatial code for social meaning in design discussions. Examining the change in function and conceptualization of the courtyard shows how different groups in post-Soviet Russia seek to retain or redeploy concepts of the ""collective"" as they attempt to remake St. Petersburg as a successful ""world"" city. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","post-socialist cities; production of space; Soviet urban planning; transnational urbanism; world cities","administration; development project; hegemony; planning history; public space; spatial planning; urban design; urban history; urban planning; world city; Leningrad; Russian Federation; Saint Petersburg","0623599, NSF, National Science Foundation",,02723638,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879197943

Egyptian doctors made medicines from plants, animal products and minerals, which they combined with magic and religious procedures. The earliest records described burns dressings with milk from mothers of male babies. Goddess Isis was called upon to help. Some remedies and procedures proved so successful that their application continued for centuries. The Edwin Smith papyrus (1500 BC) mentioned the treatment of burns with honey and grease. Ebers Papyrus (1500 BC) contains descriptions of application of mud, excrement, oil and plant extracts. They also used honey, Aloe and tannic acid to heal burns. Ancient Egyptians did not know about microorganisms but they knew that honey, moldy bread and copper salts could prevent infections from dirt in burns healing. Thyme, opium and belladona were used for pain relief. In the 4th century BC, Hippocrates recorded that Greek and Roman doctors used rendered pig fat, resin and bitumen to treat burns. Mixture of honey and bran, or lotion of wine and myrrh were used by Celsus. Honey was also known in Ayurveda (Indian medicine) time. Ayurvedic records Characa and Sushruta included honey in their dressing aids to purify sores and promote the healing. Burn treatment in Chinese medicine was traditional. It was a compilation of philosophy, knowledge and herbal medicine. The successful treatment of burns started in recent time and it has been made possible by better knowledge of the pathophysiology of thermal injuries and their consequences, medical technology advances and improved surgical techniques.",,"Asia; Burns; cultural anthropology; Egypt; Greece; history; human; procedures; traditional medicine; Asia; Burns; Egypt; Greece; History, Ancient; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Roman World",,,00258105,,,23888738,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907811911

Using graph-theoretical analysis, we investigated differences in global and regional topological properties of structural brain networks in 42 beginning readers with (FH. +) and without (FH. -) familial risk for reading difficulties. We constructed separate structural correlation networks based on measures of surface area and cortical thickness. Results revealed changes in topological properties in brain regions known to be abnormal in dyslexia (left supramarginal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus) in the FH. + group mainly in the network constructed from measures of cortical surface area.

Among them, tuberculosis (TB), produced by M. tuberculosis-complex bacteria, is historically the single most devastating infectious agent. Like many other microorganisms, M. tuberculosis resistant to antibiotics have risen as a consequence of selective pressure for mutants able to persist despite being attacked with drugs that would otherwise erradicate them from the infected person. Given the current long-term (6-9 months) therapy with multiple antibiotics, many people abandon their treatments, therefore promoting that bacteria that were not eliminated during therapy get exposed to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations, probably leading to mutations and drug resistance. In this scenario, extremely-drug resistant (XDR) TB was recognized not more than a decade ago, prompting concerns for a more complicated drug regimen with few available molecules. In recent years, either old antibiotics have been rediscovered as good measures to control XDR-TB, or new ones have emerged as alternatives to cure patients of this type of infection. In this work we aim to provide the medical community in Mexico with information of such drug regimens that have succesfully worked, in order to get their consideration for use in our country.","Antibiotic resistance; Successful treatment; Tuberculosis","antibiotic agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; article; drug resistant tuberculosis; human; infection control; medical history; medical information; medical service; Mexico; microorganism; mutant; treatment duration; Antitubercular Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Costs; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis; Humans; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; World Health",,,00348376,,RICLA,23877813,"Spanish",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881356647

Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9 and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C. tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2.3-2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5.2-6.1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought. © 2013 CSIRO.","Carcharhinidae; chondrichthyan; shark fishery","adult; age; fishery management; growth rate; life history; population estimation; quantitative analysis; reproductive biology; shark; World Heritage Site; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Carcharhinidae; Carcharhinus limbatus; Carcharhinus sorrah; Chondrichthyes",,,13231650,,AJMFA,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876519303

This study is part the project ""Nursing in Borderland-Finnmark 1939-1950"" within nursing history that sheds light on nursing and health care during World War II in Finnmark County, Northern Norway. The study focuses on challenges in nursing care that arose during the war because of war activities in the Barents area. This article focuses on challenges caused by shortage of supplies. The aim of the project is to widen the understanding of development within health care and living conditions in the area. Study design. This is a historical study using narratives, government documents and literature. Methods. Interviews with nurses and persons active in health care during World War II constitute the main data of the research. Thematic issues that arise from interviews are analysed. Primary and secondary written sources are used in analysing the topics. Because of war activities, deportation and burning of the county, archives were partly destroyed. Central archives can contribute with annual reports, whereas local archives are fragmentary. There are a number of reports written soon after the War, as well as a number of biographical books of newer date. Results. Challenges caused by war, which appear in the interviews, are: 1) shortage of supplies, 2) increased workload, 3) multicultural society, 4) ethical dilemmas, 5) deportation of the population. In this paper, focus is on challenges caused by shortage of supplies. Conclusions. Both institutions, personnel and patients were marked by the war. This has to be taken in consideration in health care today.","Finnmark County; History; Nursing; World War II","Arctic; catering service; cultural anthropology; history; history of medicine; human; interview; medical ethics; Norway; war; workload; Arctic Regions; Culture; Ethics, Clinical; Food Supply; History of Nursing; History, 20th Century; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Norway; Workload; World War II",,,12399736,,,23630668,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876892479

In various reports and newspaper articles Lacoste deployed the tools of classical geography-firsthand observation, mapping, and the integrated analysis of physical and human factors-to disclose connections among law, war, and environment (or what he termed ""geographical warfare"") that had a troubling political significance. Second, we explore how Lacoste's exposé was bound up with the theme of ""tropicality"" (the West's construction of ""the tropics"" as its environmental other), chiefly through his recourse to Gourou's (1936) study of the delta. Lacoste showed how exotic imagery of the tropics has served as a means of opposition and critique as well as a mode of othering and Western dominance. Third, Lacoste's critical engagement with Gourou points to the ambivalent critical impact that the Vietnam War had on Francophone and Anglophone geography during the 1970s and 1980s, yet also how interest in the idea of tropicality developed in French geography twenty years before the better known Anglophone critical literature on the subject emerged. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","geographical warfare; Pierre Gourou; tropicality; Vietnam War; Yves Lacoste","integrated approach; political relations; social history; war; welfare impact; historical geography; tropical region; war; Western world; Red River Delta; Viet Nam; Viet Nam",,,00045608,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876447045

World Kidney Day (WKD) has been planned to improve disease prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate CKD risk factors and urinary abnormalities, collected on WKD along several years, in men and women. Patients and methods: Between 2006 and 2012, 1980 subjects, of whom 1012 women, from general population living in Ferrara area, a town in the north-east of Italy, were investigated. For each participant age, sex, smoking, hypertensive and diabetic status, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure (BP) were obtained. Moreover, body shape index (BSI) was calculated. All subjects underwent dipstick urinalysis. Results: Men had higher BMI, WC, and BP than women. Women had higher prevalence of abdominal obesity and higher BSI (0.0951 ± 0.0105 vs. 0.0920 ± 0.0071 m 11/6kg-2/3), while men had higher prevalence of overweight. In women, hematuria and leukocyturia were more prevalent (16.9% vs. 12.8%; OR 95%CI 1.161 (1.042-1.294); p = 0.012; 18.5% vs. 7% OR 95%CI 1.538 (1.403-1.676); p &lt; 0.001, respectively), while glycosuria was less frequent (4.2% vs. 8.8% OR 95%CI 0.642 (0.501-0.822); p &lt; 0.001) than in men. Frequency of proteinuria was similar in the two sexes. Venn diagrams indicate a different overlap of urinary abnormalities in the two sexes. Conclusions: Risk factors for CKD collected during the WKD appear to be different in the two sexes, and urinary abnormalities overlap differently.

But no modern analysis of the military food rations has ever been conducted to better understand potential nutritional problems in this group. We analysed the foods in the military rations for 1915 using food composition data on the closest equivalents for modern foods. We compared these results with other plausible diets and various optimised ones using linear programming. Historical accounts provide evidence for poor food quality supplied to these soldiers. The nutrient analysis suggested that the military rations were below modern requirements for vitamins A, C and E; potassium; selenium; and dietary fibre. If military planners had used modest amounts of the canned vegetables and fruit available in 1915, this would probably have eliminated four of these six deficits. The results from the uncertainty analyses for vitamin C (e.g., 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 5.5 to 6.7 mg per day), was compatible with the range known to cause scurvy, but the UI for vitamin A intake was only partly in the range for causing night blindness. To indicate the gap with the ideal, an optimised diet (using foods available in 1915), could have achieved all nutrient requirements for under half the estimated purchase cost of the 1915 military rations. There is now both historical and analytic evidence that the military rations provided to these soldiers were nutritionally inadequate in vitamin C, and probably other nutrients such as vitamin A. These deficits are likely to have caused cases of scurvy and may have contributed to the high rates of other illnesses experienced at Gallipoli. Such problems could have been readily prevented by providing rations that included some canned fruit or vegetables (e.g., as manufactured by New Zealand at the time).",,"vitamin; article; catering service; dietary fiber; fruit; health care policy; history; human; male; malnutrition; New Zealand; nutritional requirement; nutritional value; scurvy; soldier; vegetable; war; Dietary Fiber; Food Supply; Fruit; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Malnutrition; Military Personnel; New Zealand; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Requirements; Nutritive Value; Scurvy; Vegetables; Vitamins; World War I",,,11758716,,,23797073,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883022406

It came to the attention of British medical officers serving on the island after the Crimean War. It was easy to eliminate the disease in British servicemen, but very difficult to reach Maltese citizens. Over the decades, more and more Maltese were infected as the control measures introduced were half-hearted and were often not even enforced. The work of DrThemistocles Zammit showed that infected goats transmitted brucellosis and that banning use of their milk would be effective. Pasteurisation was not introduced onto the island until the 1930s, when the production of cheap, small sterile containers became possible. Transmission was also possible through sexual contact and by inhalation when people were crowded in hot airless conditions.

Although an important role is attributed to several men of this school, who were recognized as wise and learned doctors, modern historiography has also reevaluated and extolled the praiseworthy role of women. Contrary to the common beliefs and expectations of a woman's ""place"" at the time, these women were fully titled physicians. Attention was also paid to the health and welfare of children. However, there are no apparent references to physical disabilities, a mysterious omission that seems incompatible with an institution that stood as a beacon of knowledge for centuries. Mysteries, discoveries, and potential hidden messages are mingled in a fascinating medieval codex yet to be fully deciphered. The medical school reached its maximum splendor between the years of 1000 and 1300 AD. After alternating fortunes, the Salernitan institution began a slow decline due to the explosive development of other universities, such as those in Paris, Bologna, Padua, and most significantly, the nearby University of Naples.

As a surgeon in the Russian Army in World War I, Oppel experienced the challenges and inefficiencies associated with caring for large numbers of combat wounded, the inefficiencies he observed leading to unacceptable morbidity and mortality. As a consequence, Oppel envisioned a coordinated sequence of surgical care on the battlefield and developed the concept of ""targeted evacuation."" In his work, Oppel was among the first to propose the ""right operation for the right patient at the right location at the right time."" Central to Oppel's precepts were (1) the forward positioning of surgical care close to the point of injury, (2) the development of a reserve of proficient and deployable military surgeons, and (3) the provision of specialized surgery to optimize survival and reduce morbidity. Oppel's teachings were validated during World War II in the performance of the Soviet casualty evacuation system and in all modern wars modern since. Today, nearly 100 years after the work of Vladimir Oppel, the benefits of a coordinated or ""targeted"" trauma system, working to optimize survival after trauma, are well recognized around the world.

Methods: This article uses event history analysis combined with multinomial logit regression to model the legislative response of 133 countries. Results: First, the results demonstrate that the WHO positively influenced the likelihood of a legislative response. Second, the article demonstrates that development bank aid helped to spur earlier legislative action. Third, the results demonstrate that developed countries acted earlier than developing countries. And finally, the onset and severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic was a significant influence on the legislative response. Conclusion: Multilateral organizations have a positive influence in global policy diffusion through informational advocacy, technical assistance, and financial aid. It is also clear that internal stressors play key roles in legislative action seen clearly through earlier action being taken in countries where the shock of the onset of HIV/AIDS occurred earlier and earlier responses taken where the epidemic was more severe. © 2012 Swiss School of Public Health.","Event history analysis; HIV/AIDS; Multilateral organizations; Policy diffusion; Policy process","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; article; developed country; developing country; economics; financial management; health; health care planning; health care policy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; legal aspect; statistical model; world health organization; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Financial Support; Health Plan Implementation; Health Policy; HIV Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; World Health; World Health Organization",,,16618556,,,22814480,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879555281

This paper argues that such an approach tends to overlook the crucial role played by wartime propaganda. Instead, I put emotion words, emotives and metaphors at the heart of my analysis in an attempt to understand the interplay between propaganda and biopolitical discourses that aimed to regulate civilian responses to the pandemic. Drawing on the letters of Wilfred Owen, the diaries of the cultural historian Caroline Playne and the reporting in the Northcliffe press, I argue that the stoicism exhibited by Owen and amplified in the columns of The Times and the Daily Mail is best viewed as a performance, an emotional style that reflected the politicisation of 'dread' in war as an emotion with the potential to undermine civilian morale. This was especially the case during the final year of the conflict when war-weariness set in, leading to the stricter policing of negative emotions. As a protean disease that could present as alternately benign and plague-like, the Spanish flu both drew on these discourses and subverted them, disrupting medical efforts to use the dread of foreign pathogens as an instrument of biopower. The result was that, as dread increasingly became attached to influenza, it destabilised medical attempts to regulate the civilian response to the pandemic, undermining Owen's and the Northcliffe press's emotives of stoicism.

In general, their location and resectability are the most important predictors of outcome. Surgery is curative, usually for superficial tumors of the cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres, but has a more controversial role for deep-seated midline tumors. Where gross total resection is not feasible, LGG becomes a chronic disease of childhood, and adjuvant therapies must be tailored for each individual based on age and tumor location. Radiotherapy (RT) is effective but associated with neurological, cognitive, and endocrinological morbidity, prompting the use of chemotherapy regimens aimed at delaying RT, especially in younger children. Long-term surveillance imaging for up to five years after treatment is warranted even after gross total resection, and lifelong surveillance is warranted after RT because of iatrogenic effects. Despite a favorable prognosis for survival, LGG are associated with disability, decreased quality of life, and late effects of treatment, all requiring long-term specialty care through a multidisciplinary approach.","Child; Glioma; Radiotherapy","bevacizumab; carboplatin; cisplatin; etoposide; irinotecan; lomustine; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitolactol; procarbazine; tioguanine; vincristine; allergic reaction; ataxia; backache; brain stem; brain tumor; child development; childhood cancer; computer assisted tomography; consciousness level; cranial neuropathy; delayed diagnosis; event free survival; eye movement; family history; follow up; gait; gene mutation; glioma; headache; human; hydrocephalus; immunopathology; intracranial hypertension; lethargy; macrocephaly; medical history; motor performance; nausea and vomiting; neurofibromatosis; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ophthalmoscopy; overall survival; papilledema; peripheral neuropathy; physical examination; pilocytic astrocytoma; pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma; postoperative period; primary medical care; progression free survival; review; seizure; somnolence; stereotactic radiosurgery; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma; torticollis; tumor recurrence; tumor suppressor gene; visual acuity; visual disorder; weakness; weight reduction; world health organization; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Glioma; Humans",,,00264946,,MIPEA,23612260,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879557283

That this dramatic change may be linked to the trauma of war is explored by studying the art itself, biographical material, and the artist's own insightful comments. The thesis is advanced that the catastrophe in Europe aggravated Matisse's neurotic conflicts and that his art reflects his effort to resolve these conflicts through new compromise formations and, more significantly, sublimation. Sublimation is discussed as it relates not only to the ""radical invention"" of Matisse's wartime art but also to a concurrent transformation of his personality. These ideas about Matisse are applied to clinical vignettes in a consideration of the role of sublimation in a contemporary view of therapeutic change. © American Psychoanalytic Association 2013.",,"article; history; human; painting; psychoanalysis; psychological aspect; war; History, 20th Century; Humans; Paintings; Psychoanalytic Interpretation; World War I",,,00030651,,JAPOA,23508722,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876189750

Mechanisms of commotion, emotion, and suggestion were defined in order to explain these disturbances. In France, emphasis was placed on the mechanism of suggestion, based on pithiatism, introduced by Joseph Babinski (1857-1932) before the war to highlight the concept of suggestion and its hazy border with simulation. As a result, many soldiers suffering from war neuroses became considered as simulators or malingerers who were merely attempting to escape the front. A medical-military collusion ensued with the aim of sending as many of these nervous cases back to the front as possible through the use of painful or experimental therapies. Aggressive therapies flourished including torpillage, a particularly painful form of electrotherapy developed by Clovis Vincent (1879-1947) and subsequently by Gustave Roussy (1874-1948). At the end of the war, some psychiatrists, such as Paul Sollier (1861-1933), Georges Dumas (1866-1946), and Paul Voivenel (1880-1975), developed a more psychological approach. In Great Britain, where Charles Myers (1873-1946) coined the term shell shock in 1915 to describe these cases, psychological theories were more successful. In Germany, aggressive therapies developed by Fritz Kaufmann (1875-1941) emerged in the second part of the war. In Austria, the future Nobel Prize winner Julius Wagner-Jauregg (1857-1940) was accused of performing violent therapies on patients with war neuroses. These methods, which now seem barbarian or inhuman, were largely accepted at the time in the medical community and today should be judged with caution given the cultural, patriotic, and medical background of the Great War. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","electrotherapy; posttraumatic stress disorders; torpillage; war neuroses; World War I","electrostimulation therapy; Europe; France; history; human; malingering; neuropsychiatry; neurosis; posttraumatic stress disorder; review; war; Combat Disorders; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Europe; France; History, 20th Century; Humans; Malingering; Neuropsychiatry; Neurotic Disorders; World War I",,,0964704X,,JHNEF,23586542,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876544315

By identifying and examining four primary modes - archaeology 'as evidence', 'in performance', 'in action' and 'dramatized' - it demonstrates how the on-screen presentation of ancient sites, monuments and artefacts, and the practices of archaeological investigation and excavation generate historical knowledge, and authorize it. Fundamental to this is the resonance between documentary representations of the past and viewers' experiences of antiquity through archaeology in other television programmes and alternative media and contexts: for example tourism and film. Knowledge gleaned through one cultural encounter with the ancient world encourages or conditions the viewer to accept the historical facts presented on screen. By analysing the rhetorics of a distinctive and understudied strand of history programming, this study demonstrates its place within the construction of historical knowledge in contemporary society. This allows a fresh consideration of the merits of historical documentary on television. © The Author(s) 2013.","ancient world documentary; archaeological aesthetic; documentary aesthetics; history on television; popular history; receptions of antiquity",,,,01634437,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876025013

Despite the fact that plant invasions are considered a major threat to biodiversity, they have been poorly studied or not considered a conservation priority in South America. We aim to assess alien plant distribution in Chile, using the first comprehensive public alien plant database, and discuss the implications of using herbarium records to develop national databases of alien plants. We used herbarium records to assemble a comprehensive national database of alien plants. We calculated the number of alien and native species and specimens recorded in each 10 × 10 km cell. We evaluated sampling efforts and tested for relationships between alien and native species collections, as well as other spatial patterns along the latitudinal gradient. Alien and native species richness was positively correlated. Alien plants were mostly collected in central Chile, with few species collected in both the extreme north and south. However, native plants were strongly collected in central Chile, as well as in both extremes of the country. Alien and native plants followed the same pattern of accumulation along the latitudinal gradient, with native plants being relatively more collected than alien plants. Herbarium records provide valuable baseline information to evaluate plant species distribution. However, there are important gaps in this database, (e. g. variable sampling effort for alien and native plants, incomplete information on life-history traits). Given scientists and land managers increasing demand for baseline information and the high cost of collecting such data in developing countries, herbarium records should be used more frequently for research and management of plant invasions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Botanical records; Database; Invasive species; Non-native plant; Plant richness; South America","bioaccumulation; biological invasion; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; database; developing world; herbarium; invasive species; latitudinal gradient; life history trait; native species; plant; species conservation; species richness; Chile",,,13873547,,BLINF,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874949382

It argues that the controversy left a lasting legacy precisely because of its positivist focus on documents as artefacts capable of revealing an indisputable 'truth' about the causes of the war, which shaped all subsequent debates. It further contends that the topic has sidestepped postmodern attempts to relativize history, because in an emotive debate that has for decades been defined by war-guilt allegations and apologia, the concept of historical truth is still held valid by historians participating in the debate. The article concludes by arguing that, as the First World War no longer affects contemporary politics, war-guilt no longer needs to concern those seeking to explain its causes. The shift from contemporary history to a history divorced from our own experience might lead historians finally be able to identify document-based probabilities, if not an undisputable truth, about how the war started. © 2013 The Author(s).","Fischer Controversy; historiography; origins of the First World War; postmodern critiques of history",,,,00220094,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876759134

Both Seneca and Pliny situate their work on nature within a wider Roman discourse on morality and, in particular, the dangers of luxurious, extravagant living. This moral discourse in these writers' work on nature can be seen as a Roman accretion upon an essentially Greek tradition of natural philosophy.

Latest figures indicate 2.6 billion people do not use improved sanitation and 1.1 billion practise open defecation, thus there is a huge need for sustainable and cost-effective WATSAN facilities, particularly in cities of the developing world. The objective of this study was to discuss and evaluate the applicability of selected ancient WATSAN systems for the contemporary developing world. Selected WATSAN systems in ancient Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, Egypt, Greece, Rome and the Yucatan peninsula are briefly introduced and then discussed in the context of the developing world. One relevant aspect is that public latrines and baths were not only a part of daily life in ancient Rome but also a focal point for socialising. As such they would appear to represent a model of how to promote use and acceptance of modern community toilets and ablution blocks. Although public or community toilets are not classified as improved sanitation by WHO/UNICEF, this is a debatable premise since examples such as Durban, South Africa, illustrate how community toilets continue to represent a WATSAN solution for urban areas with high population density. Meanwhile, given the need for dry sanitation technologies, toilets based on the production of enriched Terra Preta soil have potential applications in urban and rural agriculture and warrant further investigation.

Rotaviruses were found to be major pathogens worldwide, whereas the Norwalk virus could not be detected using a radioimmunoassay. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate the role and diversity of rotaviruses and noroviruses in the original cohort using more sensitive current technologies. Stools collected from Asia, Africa, and South America (n = 485) were evaluated for viral genotypes by RT-PCR and sequencing. Rotaviruses were detected in 28.9% and noroviruses in 9.7% of the specimens, with G1 rotaviruses and GII noroviruses accounting for the majority of each respective virus. Various strains in this study predated the currently assigned dates of discovery for their particular genotype, and in addition, two noroviruses (KL45 and T091) could not be assigned to current genotypes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated a relative constancy in circulating rotavirus genotypes over time, with several genotypes from this study becoming established in the current repertoire of viral species. Similarly, GII noroviruses have maintained dominance, with GII.4 noroviruses continuing as a predominant genotype over time. Taken together, the complex molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses and noroviruses circulating in the 1970's is consistent with current patterns, an important consideration in the design of multivalent vaccines to control these viruses.",,"virus vaccine; adolescent; adult; amino acid substitution; article; child; controlled study; drug design; feces analysis; genetic variability; geographic distribution; human; infant; major clinical study; microbial diversity; molecular epidemiology; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; Norovirus; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; preschool child; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rotavirus; sequence analysis; viral gastroenteritis; virus detection; virus genome; virus identification; virus strain; Adolescent; Antigens, Viral; Capsid Proteins; Child; Child, Preschool; Diarrhea; Evolution, Molecular; Gastroenteritis; Genotype; History, 20th Century; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Molecular Sequence Data; Norovirus; Phylogeny; Rotavirus; Viral Vaccines; World Health; Norwalk virus; Rotavirus",,,19326203,,,23536875,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875469105

Equianalgesic ratios for tapentadol to prior strong opioids were calculated. Methods: Patients rotated directly from prior WHO step III opioids to tapentadol. Patients received tapentadol PR (50-250 mg b.i.d.) during 5-week titration and 7-week maintenance periods. Tapentadol immediate release (IR) 50 mg (twice/day, 4 h apart) was allowed (total daily dose of tapentadol PR and IR 500 mg/day). The primary endpoint was responder rate 1 at week 6 (percentage of patients with the same or less pain intensity [11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 3-day average)] vs week -1). Results: Responder rate 1 at week 6 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) was 80.9% (76/94; P ≤ 0.0001 vs. The null responder hypothesis rate [≤60%]), resulting in a positive trial despite premature termination (136 recruited of 180 planned). Significant improvements from baseline in pain intensity and neuropathic pain symptoms were observed at weeks 6 and 12 with tapentadol PR (P ≤ 0.05). Equianalgesic ratios were calculated for PR formulations alone and for PR and IR formulations combined for tapentadol to oxycodone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone. The prevalences of adverse events reported as the reason for switching to tapentadol (most commonly constipation and nausea) decreased over time. Conclusions: Tapentadol PR (50-250 mg b.i.d.) provided at least comparable pain relief and improved tolerability versus prior strong opioids in patients with severe, chronic low back pain responding to WHO step III therapy. Conversion from strong opioids to tapentadol PR, with its two mechanisms of action, went smoothly considering overall effectiveness and tolerability outcomes. Equianalgesic ratios of tapentadol to oxycodone and other strong opioids were in line with other phase 3/3b studies. © The Author(s) 2013.","Chronic pain; Equianalgesic; Equipotency; Low back pain; Neuropathic pain; Opioid; Severe pain; Tapentadol","buprenorphine; fentanyl; hydromorphone; morphine; opiate; oxycodone; tapentadol; buprenorphine; delayed release formulation; fentanyl; hydromorphone; morphine; narcotic analgesic agent; oxycodone; phenol derivative; tapentadol; narcotic analgesic agent; phenol derivative; adult; analgesia; article; comparative study; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug exposure; drug release; drug safety; drug tolerability; female; health status; health survey; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; low back pain; major clinical study; male; Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; medical history; neuropathic pain; pain assessment; patient safety; phase 3 clinical trial; quality of life; Short Form 36; withdrawal syndrome; world health organization; aged; chemically induced; chronic pain; clinical trial; constipation; delayed release formulation; low back pain; middle aged; multicenter study; neuralgia; pain measurement; severity of illness index; therapeutic use; chemically induced disorder; chronic pain; delayed release formulation; neuralgia; Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; Chronic Pain; Constipation; Delayed-Action Preparations; Female; Fentanyl; Humans; Hydromorphone; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Morphine; Neuralgia; Oxycodone; Pain Measurement; Phenols; Severity of Illness Index; Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; Chronic Pain; Constipation; Delayed-Action Preparations; Female; Fentanyl; Humans; Hydromorphone; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Morphine; Neuralgia; Oxycodone; Pain Measurement; Phenols; Severity of Illness Index",,,0741238X,,ADTHE,23475406,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891336693

In response to a rising number of children and young persons being sentenced in the Metropolitan Juvenile Courts, magistrates and experts at the London Country Council favoured the continuation of a welfarist approach to delinquency that had operated before the war. War conditions reinforced the view that delinquency was the result of familial and social deprivation that eschewed retributive punishment. An increasing number of children and teenagers, mainly girls and often in need of care and protection, appeared before the Metropolitan Juvenile Courts. These delinquents were increasingly regarded in terms of welfare rather than as juridical subjects. However, this penal-welfarist practice, which embraced the rehabilitation of delinquents, was periodically challenged, as psychological treatment was regarded with suspicion, and the corporal punishment of boys gained in popularity in wartime. © The London Journal Trust 2013.","Evacuation; Juvenile courts; London county council; Magistrates; World War II","juvenile; legal system; social history; war; welfare provision; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",,,03058034,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874892925

The challenge for clinicians is to distinguish the recurrent RTIs with self-limiting or minor problems from those with underlying disease. The aim of this review is to describe a practical approach to children with recurrent LRTIs that limits unnecessary, expensive and time-consuming investigations. The children can be divided into three groups on the basis of their personal and family history and clinical findings: 1) otherwise healthy children who do not need further investigations; 2) those with risk factors for respiratory infections for whom a wait-and-see approach can be recommended; and 3) those in whom further investigations are mandatory. However, regardless of the origin of the recurrent LRTIs, it is important to remember that prevention by means of vaccines against respiratory pathogens (i.e. type b Haemophilus influenzae, pertussis, pneumococcal and influenza vaccines) can play a key role. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bronchiectasis; Lower respiratory tract infections; Lung; Recurrent pneumonia; Recurrent respiratory tract infections; Upper respiratory tract infections","cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; immunoglobulin; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 13; atopy; bacterial colonization; bronchiectasis; bronchoscopy; child; ciliary dyskinesia; community acquired pneumonia; disease predisposition; family history; foreign body aspiration; gastroesophageal reflux; genotype phenotype correlation; heterozygosity; human; immune deficiency; immune response; immunoregulation; indoor air pollution; innate immunity; lower respiratory tract infection; monocyte; morbidity; mortality; neutrophil; passive smoking; physical examination; pneumonia; primary ciliary dyskinesia; priority journal; recurrent disease; review; rhinoscope; rhinosinusitis; risk assessment; risk factor; substitution therapy; Child; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunization; Incidence; Recurrence; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk Factors; World Health",,,15260542,,PRRAE,23347661,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872684894

This disease affects millions of peoples globally which results in serious complications due to vasoocclusive phenomenon and haemolysis. This genetic abnormality is due to substitution of amino acid valine for the glutamic acid at the sixth position of beta chain of haemoglobin. This disease was described about one hundred year ago. The haemoglobin S (hbS) produced as result of this defect is poorly soluble and polymerized when deoxygenated. Symptoms of sickle cell disease are due to chronic anaemia, pain full crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke and susceptibility to bacterial infection. In recent years measures like prenatal screening, better medical care, parent education, immunization and penicillin prophylaxis have successfully reduced morbidity and mortality and have increased tremendously life expectancy of affected individuals. Three principal current therapeutics modalities available for childhood SCD are blood transfusion, Hydroxy urea and bone marrow transplantation. Genetic counseling, continued medical education for health professionals about sickle cell disease, its complications and management is necessary.

It is often believed that the Internet grew as a tree from a tiny acorn, the ARPANET network set up in 1969. In this study, we argue that this interpretation is incomplete at best and seriously flawed at worst. Our article makes three contributions. First, on the basis of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources we reconstruct the history of computer networks between the late 1950s and the early 1990s. We show that the ARPANET network was one among a myriad of (commercial and non-commercial) networks that developed over that period of time-the integration of these networks into an internet was likely to happen, whether ARPANET existed or not. Second, we make a systematic effort to quantify the significance of these various networks. This allows us to visualize more clearly the extent to which the ARPANET network was one among many, and not a particularly large one at that. Third, we provide a nuanced interpretation of the rise of various technologies, including the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and the World Wide Web, as 'dominant designs.' Their rise should be interpreted within the economic framework of industries with network effects, in which historical accidents bring about tipping points that lead to universal acceptance. We thus show that history matters for understanding why information systems function in the way they do. © 2013 JIT Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved.","computer networks; history of the Internet; information systems","Arpanet; Dominant design; Economic framework; Network effects; Secondary sources; Tipping point; Transmission control protocol/internet protocols; Various technologies; Computer networks; Information systems; World Wide Web; Internet protocols",,,02683962,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875173923

Germany and Austria-Hungary, under increasing domestic pressure, wanted to create facts on at least one front and demonstrate to the world at large their willingness to accept peace. In reality, the German Supreme Army Command's main goal was to bring large parts of Eastern Europe under German control and permanently weaken revolution-torn Russia. Since late 1917, Ukraine appeared to be the key to controlling the entire region: it was considered the breadbasket of the former Russian Empire, it possessed heavy industry in the East and it offered access to the Black Sea. But the Brest Treaty proved to be brittle and the contracting states showed themselves to be either politically unstable (Ukraine) or unreliable (Bolshevik Russia). Additionally, Ukraine was not even remotely capable of fulfilling its economic pledges. Furthermore, the dictated peace proved to the entente that there could be no negotiated peace with Germany and that fighting would have to continue until the capitulation of the Central Powers. This article will analyse, first, the position of Ukraine within the Central Powers' foreign-policy and military-strategic conception until the invasion in early 1918; second, the occupation policies of 1918; and, third, the Ukrainians' own perception of the Central Powers. The Ukrainian failing state exemplifies, with particular clarity, the Central Powers' strategic overstretch and their ill-considered policy in Eastern Europe at the end of the First World War.

C-reactive protein (CRP) has been assessed as a marker in individuals with CVD and/or at high risk of developing it. However, its role in schizophrenia patients is unknown. The goal of this research was thus to explore the use of CRP as a marker of CVD risk in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of the Badalona Serveis Assistencials (BSA) administrative claims database was conducted including all subjects aged. >18 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. CRP measurement, sociodemographics, medical history, 10-year CVD risk (Framingham function) and clinical chemistry data were extracted for analysis. Results: Seven hundred and five patients (53.0% men, 48.2 [15.8] years, 78.7% on atypicals) met criteria for analysis. Mean 10-year CVD risk was high; 11.9±5.7% and mean CRP levels were 2.6±2.5mg/L with 30.4% showing above-normative levels (>3mg/L). After adjusting for age, gender, smoking and presence of neoplasm or inflammatory diseases, CRP was linearly associated with 10-year CVD risk stratified by risk (low, moderate, high/very high): respectively, 2.3 (95% CI: 2.1-2.5), 3.1 (2.6-3.5) and 3.7 (3.2-4.1) mg/L; F=13.5, P<0.001.

As Achilles died because of a small wound on his heel, the term ""Achilles' heel"" has come to mean a person's principal weakness. But is the human heel a really vulnerable part of our body? Could a non-poisonous arrow have caused Achilles' death? Should an arrow be necessarily poisonous in order to cause a lethal heel would? The purpose of this effort is to explain, from an anatomic point of view, how Achilles heel wounding could have led to his death. The Achilles tendon is the strongest, largest and thickest tendon in the human body and plays an important role in the biomechanics of the lower extremity. The blood supply of the tendon is from the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries. It is quite likely that the arrow which killed Achilles was poisoned. This supposition could be of course enough to cause his death. In case the arrow was not poisoned a rupture of the posterior tibial artery by the arrow could have caused a bleeding, but it seems unlikely for such a bleeding to be lethal. Moreover, a combination of these two theories could have also taken place, i.e. a poisoned arrow traumatizing the posterior tibial artery and hence causing rapid diffusion of the poison as well as bleeding. Furthermore, infectious and/or immunologic bases regarding Achilles' death could be considered. In our opinion, a poisoned arrow was probably the crucial factor leading to the famous inglorious death of this famous glorious Homeric hero.

The results show that after the conversion of wetlands to cropland, a longer reclamation history (&gt;20 yr) resulted in greater soil bulk density, salinity, clay and silt, and lower soil moisture, SOC and sand content, whereas a shorter reclamation history (&lt;20 yr) induced smaller values for soil pH, moisture and sand. Ditch marshes had greater average SOC in the top 50 cm than fringe marshes and cropland. SOC decreased generally down soil profiles from 0 to 50 cm in depth, except for the obvious accumulation of SOC in deeper soils from old fringe and young ditch marshes. Ditch marshes had the greatest SOC densities in the top 50 cm in both regions compared to the other land uses. SOC densities in the top 50 cm were less in croplands than in fringe marshes in the young region, while there were no significant differences between them in the older one. Except for cropland, SOC densities in the top 50 cm of the fringe or ditch marshes in the old region were not significantly different from those in the young region. SOC in both regions was reduced by 13.53 × 104 t (12.98%) in the top 50 cm of the marshes after conversion to cropland, whereas the regional SOC storage increased by 29.25 t when ditch marshes were included. The results from regression analysis show that bulk density and soil moisture significantly influenced SOC. The total SOC stored in both ditch marshes and croplands was higher compared to fringe marshes. The regional SOC storage in the top 50 cm was not reduced after reclamation due to C accumulation in the ditch marshes. The regional effects of cultural practices should be taken into account in devising strategies for managing soils in coastal wetlands, particularly in the developing world. © 2013 The Authors.

Tweets are ranked in chronological order regardless of their potential interestedness. Users have to scan through pages of tweets to find useful information. Thus more personalized ranking scheme is needed to filter the overwhelmed information. Since retweet history reveals users' personal preference for tweets, we study how to learn a predictive model to rank the tweets according to their probability of being retweeted. In this way, users can find interesting tweets in a short time. To model the retweet behavior, we build a graph made up of three types of nodes: users, publishers and tweets. To incorporate all sources of information like users' profile, tweet quality, interaction history, etc, nodes and edges are represented by feature vectors. All these feature vectors are mapped to node weights and edge weights. Based on the graph, we propose a feature-aware factorization model to re-rank the tweets, which unifies the linear discriminative model and the low-rank factorization model seamlessly. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on a real dataset crawled from Twitter. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our model. © 2013 ACM.","recommender system; social media","Chronological order; Discriminative models; Edge weights; Factorization model; Feature vectors; Interaction history; Low rank; Personal preferences; Predictive models; Re-ranking; Social media; Sources of informations; Data mining; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Information retrieval",,,,9781450318693,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874224568

Early diagnosis and adequate management are critical to reduce mortality. This study aims to identify clinical and hematological features that could be useful to discriminate dengue from other febrile illnesses (OFI) up to the third day of disease.Methods: We conducted a sectional diagnostic study with patients aged 12 years or older who reported fever lasting up to three days, without any evident focus of infection, attending an outpatient clinic in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between the years 2005 and 2008. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify symptoms, physical signs, and hematological features valid for dengue diagnosis. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to define the best cut-off and to compare the accuracy of generated models with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for probable dengue.Results: Based on serological tests and virus genome detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 69 patients were classified as dengue and 73 as non-dengue. Among clinical features, conjunctival redness and history of rash were independent predictors of dengue infection. A model including clinical and laboratory features (conjunctival redness and leukocyte counts) achieved a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 71% and showed greater accuracy than the WHO criteria for probable dengue.Conclusions: We constructed a predictive model for early dengue diagnosis that was moderately accurate and performed better than the current WHO criteria for suspected dengue.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between anemia and mortality among patients with ACS. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE to identify cohort studies and secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials examining the association between anemia and all-cause mortality among patients with ACS. Data were aggregated at 4 follow-up times (inhospital, 30 days, 1 year, and maximal available follow-up) using random-effects meta-analysis models. Results: Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 233,144 patients. Anemia was present in 44,519 (19.1%) of these patients. Anemic patients were generally older and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and history of major bleeding. Anemia was associated with an increased risk of crude all-cause mortality (relative risk 2.08, 95% CI 1.70-2.55) and reinfarction (relative risk 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.53) at maximal available follow-up. When adjusted risk ratios from individual studies' multivariable regression analyses were pooled, the magnitude of the associated mortality risk was attenuated but remained significant at maximal follow-up (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81). Clinically and statistically significant increases in mortality were observed as early as at 30 days post-ACS and persisted at 1 year. Conclusions: Anemia in patients with ACS is independently associated with a significantly increased risk of early and late mortality. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

New, best medical treatment including statins, beta-blockers, antiplatelet therapies, and better diabetes and blood pressure control might reduce the incidence of stroke in this patient population making invasive treatment unnecessary. However, patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis cannot be considered a homogenous population, and therefore, the therapeutic approach should take into consideration a subgroup of patients with greater risk of cerebrovascular event. Unfortunately, these risk factors are not well categorized thus far, although multiple publications have addressed each one of these factors individually. Recognizing these risk factors is essential for optimizing surveillance and therapeutic approach based on individual risk. The purpose of this article is to review such factors, including patient history, presence of embolic signals on Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and plaque morphology. These factors should identify high risk asymptomatic individuals who could benefit from carotid stenting or carotid endarterectomy.","Carotid stenosis; Endarterectomy; Stents; Stroke","cardiovascular risk; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; carotid endarterectomy; cerebrovascular accident; embolism; high risk patient; human; intravascular ultrasound; medical history; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; review; transcranial doppler; blood vessel transplantation; carotid artery; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; cerebrovascular accident; health; incidence; methodology; risk assessment; risk factor; stent; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Stenosis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Humans; Incidence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stents; Stroke; World Health",,,00219509,,JCVSA,23296416,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874420101

Western hegemony prevails in this academic endeavour. To recover one of the many lost traditions of higher education, this paper will make a historical comparison of the two distinctive academic traditions representing the West and East: Scholasticism revived in the twelfth century and Korean Confucianism revived in the sixteenth century. If the University Paris was where Scholasticism blossomed in the medieval period, then it is in the material relation between a mentor and his disciples, through which a distinctive academic lineage was formed, where the renaissance of Korean Confucianism has taken place since the early sixteenth century. The paper examines some of the indisputable differences between the Western and Eastern methods of reaching academic excellence. The goals, subjects, methods and organisational bases of education in the two traditions do differ drastically. Instead of the centrality of the institution in the West, the centrality of relation was the key factor in the East. These differences however do not support for any value judgment of one tradition being superior to the other, as seen in many books on world history of higher education. A single minded analysis of a foreign model from the Western perspective will not provide a global history, but a historical comparison will. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"hegemony; higher education; historical perspective; social history; Western world",,,03050068,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874482315

Many of the facts implied in the popular yet non-standard use of ""globalization"" reflect our identification of the ""transition from history to world history."" However, this has failed to bring about a realization of the structural changes in world history that are taking place in the course of this transition. The ""transition from history to world history"" has led to the emergence of ""international society"" and ""global society,"" which together constitute the ""dual structure"" of world history. Despite differences in their main structure and interest structure, their development goals and principles, and in their characteristics and patterns, international society and global society are interconnecting and interpenetrating. On the basis of a critique of ""globalizing"" ""world history"" and a scientific analysis of the situation and trends in contemporary world history, the ""dual structure"" theory of world history is a good entry point both for the full application to globalization of the Marxist view of world history and research on its development and for the contemporary development of the Marxist view of world history. At the same time, this theory will also provide methodological support for our exploration of socialist China's developmental road in a globalizing world. © 2013 Copyright Social Sciences in China Press.","global society; globalization; international society; world history",,,,02529203,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876060889

It is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third cause of cancer-related mortality. Approximately 90% of HCCs are associated with a known risk factor, mainly hepatitis B and cirrhosis which is a true precancerous state, whatever its cause. The incidence of HCC in a patient with cirrhosis is 3-5% per year. In eastern Asia and sub-saharan Africa the dominant risk factor is chronic hepatitis B infection (together with exposure to aflatoxin B1 in Africa). In developped countries, hepatitis C and alcohol use are the main risk factors, and the incidence of HCC is growing, owing probably to the hepatitis C epidemic, the increasing incidence of non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the better prevention and treatment of other complications of cirrhosis. In France, NASH is currently the second cause of cirrhosis with HCC after alcohol. The high mortality of HCC is due to a late diagnosis at an advanced stage. This is why screening of high risk patients is a major issue. The current recommendation is a biannual liver ultrasonography for cirrhotic patients, but only 20% of all HCCs are today diagnosed during a surveillance program. Surgical resection, liver transplantation and radiofrequency ablation are the 3 validated curative treatments. In France, only one fourth of all HCC patients are treated with a curative intent. Most patients are therefore treated with palliative treatments that include chemoembolization, multi-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib) and in almost one third of cases only best supportive care.

The Incas were but the culmination of a succession of civilisations that rose and fell to leave one of the richest archaeological records on Earth. By no coincidence, the Andes are home also to our greatest surviving link to the speech of the New World before European conquest: the Quechua language family. For linguists, the native tongues of the Andes make for another rich seam of data on origins, expansions, and reversals throughout prehistory. Historians and anthropologists, meanwhile, negotiate many pitfalls to interpret the conflicting mytho-histories of the Andes, recorded for us only through the distorting prism of the conquistadors' world-view. Each of these disciplines opens up its own partial window on the past: very different perspectives, to be sure, but all the more complementary for it. Frustratingly though, specialists in each field have all too long proceeded largely in ignorance of great strides being taken in the others. This book brings together a cast of scholars from each discipline, converging their disparate perspectives into a true cross-disciplinary focus, to weave together a coherent account of what was, after all, one and the same prehistory.

Inc., Global Health Outcomes, Whitehouse Station, NJ, United States","Background: Anogenital warts (AGWs) are a common, highly infectious disease caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), whose high recurrence rates contribute to direct medical costs, productivity loss and increased psychosocial impact. Because of the lack of a systematic review of the epidemiology of AGWs in the literature, this study reviewed the published medical literature on the incidence and prevalence of AGWs. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on the worldwide incidence and prevalence of AGWs between 2001 and 2012 using the PubMed and EMBASE databases. An additional screening of abstracts from relevant sexual health and infectious disease conferences from 2009 to 2011 was also conducted. Only original studies with general adult populations (i.e., at least including ages 20 through 40 years) were included. Results: The overall (females and males combined) reported annual incidence of any AGWs (including new and recurrent) ranged from 160 to 289 per 100,000, with a median of 194.5 per 100,000. New AGW incidence rates among males ranged from 103 to 168 per 100,000, with a median of 137 per 100,000 and among females from 76 to 191 per 100,000, with a median of 120.5 per 100,000 per annum. The reported incidence of recurrent AGWs was as high as 110 per 100,000 among females and 163 per 100,000 among males. Incidence peaked before 24 years of age in females and between 25 and 29 years of age among males. The overall prevalence of AGWs based on retrospective administrative databases or medical chart reviews or prospectively collected physician reports ranged from 0.13% to 0.56%, whereas it ranged from 0.2% to 5.1% based on genital examinations. Conclusions: The literature suggests that AGWs are widespread and the prevalence depends on study methodology as suggested by higher rates reported from routine genital examinations versus those from treatment records. However, there remains a need for more population-based studies from certain regions including Africa, Latin America and Southern Asia to further elucidate the global epidemiology of this disease. © 2013 Patel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Anogenital warts; Condylomata acuminate; Epidemiology; Incidence; Prevalence","adolescent; adult; Africa; age distribution; aged; article; child; condyloma acuminatum; disease surveillance; female; health care management; human; life history; major clinical study; male; medical record review; population risk; recurrent infection; risk assessment; school child; self report; sex difference; sexual health; South and Central America; South Asia; systematic review; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Condylomata Acuminata; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; World Health; Young Adult",,,14712334,,BIDMB,23347441,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872797670

How, too, did he become a major commercial success, churning out nearly two hundred ""translations"" over twenty years? With rich detail and lively prose, Lin Shu, Inc., crosses the fields of literary studies, intellectual history, and print culture, offering new ways to understand the stakes of translation in China and beyond. This book shows how Lin Shu (1852-1924) rose from obscurity to become China's leading translator of Western fiction at the beginning of the twentieth century. Well before Ezra Pound's and Bertolt Brecht's ""inventions"" of China revolutionized poetry and theater, Lin Shu and his assistants-who did, in fact, know languages like English and French-had already given many Chinese readers their first taste of fiction from the United States, France, and England. After passing through Lin Shu's ""factory of writing,"" classic novels like Uncle Tom's Cabin and Oliver Twist spoke with new meaning for audiences concerned with the tumultuous social and political change facing China. Leveraging his success as a translator of foreign books, Lin Shu quickly became an authority on ""traditional"" Chinese culture who upheld the classical language as a cornerstone of Chinese national identity. Eventually, younger intellectuals-who had grown up reading his translations-turned on Lin Shu and tarred him as a symbol of backward conservatism. Ultimately, Lin's defeat and downfall became just as significant as his rise to fame in defining the work of the intellectual in modern China. © Oxford University Press 2013.

This increase is reported to have leveled off recently in several Northern and Western European countries, Australia, New Zealand and in North America. We studied the global patterns and time trends in incidence of melanoma by country and sex, with a focus on and age- and cohort-specific variations. We analyzed the incidence data from 39 population-based cancer registries, examining all-ages and age-truncated standardized incidence rates of melanoma, estimating the annual percentage change and incidence rate ratios from age-period-cohort models. Incidence rates of melanoma continue to rise in most European countries (primarily Southern and Eastern Europe), whereas in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, Israel and Norway, rates have become rather stable in recent years. Indications of a stabilization or decreasing trend were observed mainly in the youngest age group (25-44 years). Rates have been rising steadily in generations born up to the end of the 1940s, followed by a stabilization or decline in rates for more recently born cohorts in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada and Norway. In addition to the birth cohort effect, there was a suggestion of a period-related influence on melanoma trends in certain populations. Although our findings provide support that primary and secondary prevention can halt and reverse the observed increasing burden of melanoma, they also indicate that those prevention measures require further endorsement in many countries.

Robert Koch's momentous discovery was a major breakthrough in the fight against tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the disease has never been fully controlled. Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease localized in 90-95% of cases in the lungs, and therefore it is extremely difficult to diagnose unequivocally in paleopathological material. Only the form of osteo-arthritis leaves traces in archaeological material. The earliest evidence of tuberculosis (the location of the spine, Pott's disease) in the form of fossils is dated to before 8000 BC. Another very old trace is considered to be human remains from the Neolithic period (ca 5000 BC), found near Heidelberg, where changes in the thoracic spine are typical for spondylitis in tuberculosa.

Historical sources recounting strange voices and visions may in fact have been describing manifestations of epileptic seizures rather than more supernatural phenomena. Well-documented accounts of such experiences exist for three individuals in particular: Socrates, St Paul and Joan of Arc. The great philosopher Socrates described a 'daimonion' that would visit him throughout his life. This daimonion may have represented recurrent simple partial seizures, while the peculiar periods of motionlessness for which Socrates was well known may have been the result of co-existing complex partial seizures. St Paul's religious conversion on the Road to Damascus may have followed a temporal lobe seizure which would account for the lights, voices, blindness and even the religious ecstasy he described. Finally, Joan of Arc gave a detailed narrative on the voices she heard from childhood during her Trial of Condemnation. Her auditory hallucinations appear to follow sudden acoustic stimuli in a way reminiscent of idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features. By analysing passages from historical texts, it is possible to argue that Socrates, St Paul and Joan of Arc each had epilepsy. © The Author(s) 2013.","Epilepsy; Hallucinations; Joan of Arc; Socrates; St Paul","article; cultural anthropology; epilepsy; France; hallucination; history; Joan of Arc; public figure; retrospective study; Socrates; St Paul; temporal lobe epilepsy; Epilepsy; hallucinations; Joan of Arc; Socrates; St Paul; Epilepsy, Complex Partial; Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe; Famous Persons; France; Greek World; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Retrospective Studies; Roman World",,,09677720,,,24585826,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901455630

In this article, I examine the influence of biomedical knowledge (and the professionals that wield it) in determining the acceptable and rational limits of influenza public policy from 1918 to today. Particular attention is given to the role that medical practitioners have played in shaping post-World War II influenza policy and governance structures, together with the development, deployment, and political effect of more recent biomedical techniques - such as evidence-based medicine - in reinforcing the importance attached to influenza vaccines and antivirals. The article concludes by discussing how the intense focus on pharmaceutical-based solutions reflects a particular view of biomedicine that has had serious political implications in distorting global health governance arrangements, and I argue that only by unpacking these structures and revealing the political authority in play can alternative policy responses more appropriate to a wider proportion of humanity be considered. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.",,"influenza vaccine; drug development; educational attainment; governance approach; health care; influenza; medicine; state role; vaccine; article; health; health care policy; history; human; influenza; Influenza virus A H1N1; pandemic; politics; world health organization; Health Policy; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; Politics; World Health; World Health Organization",,,00207314,,IJHSC,23527457,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873574364

In the nineteenth century, advances in anesthesia, asepsis, and cerebral localization slowly took hold and created the groundwork for modern neurosurgery. To better understand the advances in the treatment of brain injuries in the late 1800s and early 1900s, we examine relevant historical literature and, through the courtesy of the Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives, we review Dr. Harvey Cushing's patient records (1898-1909) in the Johns Hopkins Hospital surgical archives. The original case histories of 10 patients (6 in detail) who suffered head injuries and underwent treatment by Cushing illustrate some of Cushing's early attempts at intracranial surgery. We also examine the influences on Cushing as he developed into a leader in the new era of modern neurosurgery. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","brain injuries; craniocerebral trauma; Harvey Cushing; head injuries; history of medicine; neurosurgical procedures","article; Europe; head injury; history; human; military medicine; neurosurgery; United States; war; Baltimore; Craniocerebral Trauma; Europe; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; Humans; Military Medicine; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; World War I",,,0964704X,,JHNEF,23323535,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872864116

At the same time, learning games have proved that they can be a source of enjoyment and are, if well-made, powerful tools for communicating knowledge. For cultural heritage projects targeted to raising the awareness of the general public, the integration of interactivity and innovative storytelling techniques can be supporting elements to capture their target audiences' enthusiasm. In particular, games that deal with art history have particular flaws in integrating motivating elements. This observation led us to the development of the 3D online learning game, ThIATRO, that immerses the player an exhibition and, as a side-effect communicates knowledge of art history concepts to the player. Its playful approach not only increases motivation to learn but also raises interest in art history and cultural heritage in general. We provide an overview of the design ideas behind ThIATRO and summarize the results of evaluations conducted with a group of 14-year-old pupils in a classroom environment. The results indicate that ThIATRO changes the player's aesthetic response and allows him or her to perceive art on a deeper level. © 2013 ACM.","3D virtual world; Art history; Game-based learning; Serious games","Three dimensional; Virtual reality; 3d virtual worlds; Art history; Art history concepts; Classroom environment; Cultural heritages; Game-based Learning; Online learning; Serious games; Motivation",,,15564673,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979822865

However, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, Allvar Gullstrand, was well aware of the activities in the field and strongly recommended that only von Laue should receive the prize since a main contributor, William Laurence Bragg, was not nominated. Next year, when the First World War had started, there were few nominations, but now both Braggs, father and son, were nominated. Gullstrand was very pleased and recommended them both for the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics.

At that time Prof. Sjöqvist and his unit had already earned an international reputation, and in the following decades this success has been magnified many times. Although a description of the research performed by Prof. Sjöqvist during his long career is not the main objective of this article, it is clear that the research carried out in his unit has been instrumental in the development of his international reputation. Over an 18-year period from 1994 onwards, some 272 papers bearing the name of Folke Sjöqvist have been cited over 13,000 times, with an average of over 50 citations per paper. In terms of training clinical pharmacologists from around the world, at the last count 112 individuals from 37 different countries have received a substantial part of their training in his unit. As another measure of his world-wide success, 33 individuals from 18 different countries who received a substantial part of their training in his unit between 1968 and 1996 have gone on to become professors of clinical pharmacology. Prof. Sjöqvist has been requested to consult on various aspects of clinical pharmacology in 15 different countries, from Russia to Spain and from Egypt to Latvia. Here I describe the long-term involvement that Prof. Sjöqvist has had with IUPHAR (now the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology) and with institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO). In particular, I recount his role in the long-term saga involved in updating the original WHO manifesto on clinical pharmacology published in 1970 up to the eventual success of the new manifesto published by WHO in 2012. Finally, I briefly describe the international honours that have been bestowed on Prof. Sjöqvist, including various prizes, designated lectureships and honorary Doctorates (5). Taken together, these honours provide a magnificent measure of Prof. Sjöqvist's world wide-success - a success that has been emulated by very few clinical pharmacologists. © Springer-Verlag 2013.",,"Australia; awards and prizes; Canada; career; China; clinical pharmacology; Egypt; expectation; field study; France; Germany; Ghana; human; India; Italy; Japan; Latvia; Netherlands; Nigeria; Norway; personal experience; priority journal; professionalism; review; Russian Federation; South Korea; Spain; training; United Kingdom; United States; Uruguay; world health organization; academic achievement; article; history; organization; Sweden; Academies and Institutes; Education, Graduate; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Pharmacology, Clinical; Sweden",,,00316970,,EJCPA,23640182,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886743853

Its principal concerns are the manner in which historians grant agency to animals and how that agency functions in historical narration. The article examines the histories of animals in Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and North America in order to tease out the similarities and differences of human experiences with other animals. The foundational premise of the article is that humans are animals, sometimes even a meaty prey species, and that, as such, they are not external to nature or, ultimately, different from other animals in this regard. Humans can have violently intimate relationships with other creatures, an intimacy that defines much of global human history. Animals permeate our history and we theirs: tug at the threads and our stories, woven as they are into the same tightly knit tapestry, will not disentwine. The debate regarding whether humans are anomalous and outside nature or separate from other animals is complicated when the stomach enzymes from an animal, whether wolf or crocodile, digest a human being. Therefore, the cultural-constructionist arguments regarding ""the animal"" - that our understanding of nonhuman animals is entirely culturally generated - need to be viewed as overly simplistic. My contention is that our reluctance to join the rest of the animal kingdom on its terms, on more natural terms, exposes a lingering devotion to human ""exceptionalism,"" one that is inherent in the humanities and social sciences. © Wesleyan University 2013.","Animals; Biology; Environmental history; History; World history",,,,00182656,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898429214

It aims to discuss how the council urged individual advertisers to use their product-ads to instruct the civilian population about behavioral changes that the government deemed essential to the war effort. The task required great ambidexterity: paying a high level of attention to the government’s wartime needs while coaching and encouraging advertisers into compliance. As such, the article also aims to discuss the council’s challenge in weighing the government’s wartime needs against commercial pressures. A case study of the Advertising Council’s 1944 campaign to “Stamp out VD” seeks to illustrate the latter concern. Design/methodology/approach - The article comprises an historical account of the US advertising industry during the Second World War. Applying a qualitative approach, it relies on archival sources, industry trade publications, newspapers accounts and existing scholarship for its information. Findings - While publicly framing its wartime contribution as a patriotic gesture, the council’s underlying rationale was that of serving the advertising industry in a public relations capacity. Unsure of its standing as America entered the war, the donation of time and talent to the government’s war effort helped strengthen the advertising industry’s economic position and social standing. As such, the council was not only a pioneer of “social marketing”, but also demonstrated a sophisticated use of “strategic philanthropy,” long before it became a common marketing practice.

This 2012 survey was performed to collect information on existing data on the global patterns and prevalence of food allergy by surveying all the national member societies of the World Allergy Organization, and some of their neighbouring countries. Data were collected from 89 countries, including published data, and changes in the health care burden of food allergy. More than half of the countries surveyed (52/89) did not have any data on food allergy prevalence. Only 10% (9/89) of countries had accurate food allergy prevalence data, based on oral food challenges (OFC). The remaining countries (23/89) had data largely based on parent-reporting of a food allergy diagnosis or symptoms, which is recognised to overestimate the prevalence of food allergy. Based on more accurate measures, the prevalence of clinical (OFC proven) food allergy in preschool children in developed countries is now as high as 10%. In large and rapidly emerging societies of Asia, such as China, where there are documented increases in food allergy, the prevalence of OFC-proven food allergy is now around 7% in pre-schoolers, comparable to the reported prevalence in European regions. While food allergy appears to be increasing in both developed and developing countries in the last 10-15 years, there is a lack of quality comparative data. This survey also highlights inequities in paediatric allergy services, availability of adrenaline auto-injectors and standardised National Anaphylaxis Action plans. In conclusion, there remains a need to gather more accurate data on the prevalence of food allergy in many developed and developing countries to better anticipate and address the rising community and health service burden of food allergy. © 2013 Prescott et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Allergic disease; Allergy epidemic; Allergy prevention; Food allergens; Food allergy","adrenalin; food allergen; immunoglobulin E; Africa; allergy test; anaphylaxis; artificial milk; child; child health care; complementary feeding; developed country; developing country; Eastern Europe; epinephrine autoinjector; food allergy; health care organization; health care planning; health survey; human; infant feeding; medical history; medical information; medical society; meta analysis (topic); Middle East; North America; oral food challenge; Pacific islands; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; review; self report; South America; symptom assessment; time series analysis; Western Europe; world allergy organization; world health organization",,,19394551,,,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898545408

This article is aimed at expanding the image of AT dominant in the mainstream which reduces the AT trend to A.N. Leontiev's theory. This reduction impoverishes the creative potentialities of the trend, and decreases the ability of AT to contribute to international science. We aim to reveal that AT is not limited to Leontiev's approach, to explain which ideas of the founders of AT, S.L. Rubinstein and L.S. Vygotsky, were pursued and which were rejected by A.N. Leontiev, and to assess another important contribution to the AT trend - the theory of B.G. Ananiev, where the ideas of AT's founders were developed which were not succeeded by A.N. Leontiev. Historical causes and consequences of the general reduction of the image of AT in the mainstream to Leontiev's theory are considered: why the discrepancies between views of Rubinstein, Vygotsky and Leontiev were hardly ever discussed in public and why other theories contemporary to Leontiev's theory were never given account appropriate to their value in Russia and remain almost unknown abroad. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","A.N.

Tuberculosis (TB) control was beset with obstacles - BCG vaccination was found ineffective in TB control in 1979; human immunodeficiency virus began spreading in India since 1984 with TB as the commonest opportunistic disease; multi-drug resistance was found to be prevalent since 1992. The World Health Organization declared TB as global emergency in 1993. Yet, RNTCP was extended to the whole nation very slowly, taking 13 years from inception. The first objective of RNTCP, namely 85% treatment success has been achieved and case-fatality had dropped by 90%. Still, TB burden continues to remain huge; about half the cases are not getting registered under RNTCP; pediatric TB is neglected; TB drains national economy of US$ 23 billion annually. Therefore, TB control is in urgent need of re-design and re-invigoration, with additional inputs and system re-organization to cover all such gaps. We highlight the need for Public Health infrastructure under which all vertical disease control projects such as RNTCP should be synergized for better efficiency and for establishing Public Health Surveillance for collecting denominator-based data on incidence and prevalence to guide course corrections. India ought to spend 3 to 5 times more on TB control than at present. Control needs clear epidemiologic definition and measurable parameters for monitoring the level of control over time.

An overview of that record finds that transfusions were first reported in Africa (sub-Saharan and excluding South Africa) in the early 1920s, and organized transfusion practices were established before the Second World War. Blood transfusion grew rapidly after 1945, along with the construction of new hospitals and expanded health services in Africa. Significant differences existed between colonial powers in the organization of transfusion services, but these converged after independence as their use continued to grow and decentralized and hospital-based practices were adopted. It was only after the oil crisis in the mid-1970s that health spending declined and the collection, testing, and transfusion of blood began to level off. Thus, when the AIDS crisis hit transfusion services, they were already struggling to meet the needs of patients. At this time, foreign assistance as well as the World Health Organization and the League of Red Cross Societies helped respond to both the immediate problem of testing blood, and for some countries, support existed for the broader reorganization of transfusion. Overall, the history shows that transfusion was adopted widely and quickly, limited mainly by the availability of knowledgeable doctors and hospital facilities. There was less resistance than expected by Africans to receive transfusions, and the record shows a remarkable flexibility in obtaining blood. The dangers of disease transmission were recognized from an early date but were balanced against the potential lifesaving benefits of transfusion. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Africa; blood donor; blood safety; blood transfusion; health care organization; health service; history; hospital; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; knowledge; physician; review; Adult; Africa South of the Sahara; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; Blood Safety; Blood Transfusion; Blood-Borne Pathogens; Colonialism; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Services Accessibility; History, 20th Century; HIV Infections; Humans; International Cooperation; Male; Red Cross; Viremia; World War II",,,08877963,,TMERE,22981696,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872275599

It contends that British approaches were defined through a system of military pathology, which had been established by the War Office as part of the mobilization of medicine for the First World War. Relying on the bacteriological laboratory for the identification and control of pathogenic agents, military pathology delivered therapeutic and preventive measures against a range of battlefield diseases, and military and civilian authorities trusted that it could do the same with influenza. This article traces how it shaped efforts to establish the etiology of the pandemic and to produce a general influenza vaccine. It highlights the challenges involved in both strategies. Understanding the central role of military pathology helps make sense of the nature, direction, scale, and limitations of medical mobilization against the pandemic in Britain and the authority accorded to specific medical bodies for elaborating and coordinating strategies. Crucially, it demands that we rethink the relationship between the war and pandemic as one about the social organization of medical knowledge and institutions. © 2011 The Author.","1918 influenza pandemic; British military medicine; influenza vaccines; pathology and war","influenza vaccine; article; history; human; influenza; military medicine; pandemic; soldier; United Kingdom; war; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; Pandemics; World War I",,,00225045,,JHMAA,21911334,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871347957

Present profile of Indian pediatric chest services include: asthma, recurrent infections, bronchiectasis, etc. It is expected to change and the emerging pulmonary illnesses include: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection) associated pulmonary illnesses, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, interstitial lung diseases, gastroesophageal reflux diseases, neuromuscular illnesses, sleep disorders, disorders due to malformations and opportunistic pulmonary infections. Respiratory infections constitute major load in pediatric outpatient services and are the leading cause of mortality in under-five children. To reduce morbidity and mortality due to respiratory tract infections, Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) has developed Respiratory Tract Infection Group Education Module (RTIGEMS). After initial increase in prevalence of asthma, it seems to have stabilized now but going by the numbers, it will remain a major health problem in India. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was always a challenge to pediatricians and with emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis, it is even more challenging. Presently few centers are providing specialized Pediatric pulmonology services in India. There is a need to develop more centers to enhance services including (a) assessment of pulmonary physiology by performing pulmonary function testing in all age groups, (b) improving diagnostic and therapeutic role of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, (c) sweat testing, (d) molecular diagnostics for various respiratory illnesses, and (e) utilizing advance imaging and minimally invasive technologies for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory illnesses. At present there is no degree course in Pediatric Pulmonology in India. Initially middle level pediatricians wanting to pursue their career in pediatric pulmonology should undergo training in existing centers.

Methods: We performed a single-group cross-sectional study. In a 7-month period, from September 2010. The study was conducted in a cardiac rehabilitation setting at a university hospital. Overall, 273 patients, with an established diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, who were referred to the cardiac rehabilitation center, were included. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism. We also compared cardiovascular disease risk profile among participants. Results: One hundred twenty-one participants (44%) had diabetes mellitus, of which, for 80 patients, the diagnosis was previously established. Of the 193 patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, 52 patients (27%) had normal glucose levels, 41 (21.2%) had diabetes, 51 (26.4%) showed impaired glucose tolerance, and 49 (25.4%) had isolated impaired fasting glucose according to the American Diabetic Association criteria. Consistent with the World Health Organization criteria, 27 patients (14%) would have had isolated impaired fasting glucose and using fasting criteria alone, 22 patients would have had undiagnosed diabetes. CONCLUSION:: Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance did not identify the same patients. It seems that both fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance test are necessary in the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism in patients with coronary artery disease. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","cardiac rehabilitation; impaired glucose metabolism; prevalence","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; homocysteine; adult; article; cardiovascular risk; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism; family history; female; glucose blood level; heart rehabilitation; human; hyperlipidemia; impaired glucose tolerance; major clinical study; male; oral glucose tolerance test; patient referral; prevalence; priority journal; smoking; waist circumference; Aged; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fasting; Female; Glucose Intolerance; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Incidence; Iran; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Voluntary Health Agencies; World Health Organization",,,19327501,,,23221808,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873089864

These processes reflect the human need to learn about and in some instances preserve the past and can be considered part of fulfilling the basic human need of situating ourselves in time. Archaeologists in general advocate the use of technology and often adapt techniques from other industries in their research and to disseminate information about archaeology. The process of facilitating public involvement and education in archaeology is known as 'Public Archaeology'. The Internet allows the representation and recording of archaeological material and sites and the dissemination of information to a wide audience in new ways. The construction of an archaeological virtual world provides the opportunity for archaeologists to introduce collaborative E-learning opportunities to the public and engage them in a set of archaeology related activities. It has been suggested that this type of learning environment allows the construction, manipulation and exploration of virtual objects and provides a more effective learning environment than 2-D alternatives. This paper explores the contribution of 1CT in the construction of virtual archaeology worlds and the impact it has on archaeological dissemination.","E-leaming; ICT; Public archaeology; Virtual worlds","Computer aided instruction; Cybernetics; E-learning; Information dissemination; Information science; Information technology; Interactive computer graphics; Virtual reality; Archaeological materials; Collaborative e-Learning; E-leaming; Effective Learning Environment; ICT; Information and Communication Technologies; Public archaeology; Virtual worlds; History",,,,9781936338832,,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896472876

SUMMARY ANSWER It was possible to produce an international consensus statement on the current management of endometriosis through engagement of representatives of national and international, medical and non-medical societies with an interest in endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Management of endometriosis anywhere in the world has been based partially on evidence-based practices and partially on unsubstantiated therapies and approaches. Several guidelines have been developed by a number of national and international bodies, yet areas of controversy and uncertainty remain, not least due to a paucity of firm evidence. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A consensus meeting, in conjunction with a pre- and post-meeting process, was undertaken.PARTICIPANTS/ MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS A consensus meeting was held on 8 September 2011, in conjunction with the 11th World Congress on Endometriosis in Montpellier, France. A rigorous pre- and post-meeting process, involving 56 representatives of 34 national and international, medical and non-medical organizations from a range of disciplines, led to this consensus statement. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE A total of 69 consensus statements were developed. Seven statements had unanimous consensus; however, none of the statements were made without expression of a caveat about the strength of the statement or the statement itself. Only two statements failed to achieve majority consensus. The statements covered global considerations, the role of endometriosis organizations, support groups, centres or networks of expertise, the impact of endometriosis throughout a woman's life course, and a full range of treatment options for pain, infertility and other symptoms related to endometriosis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This consensus process differed from that of formal guideline development. A different group of international experts from those participating in this process would likely have yielded subtly different consensus statements. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This is the first time that a large, global, consortium, representing 34 major stake-holding organizations from five continents, has convened to systematically evaluate the best available current evidence on the management of endometriosis, and to reach consensus. In addition to 18 international medical organizations, representatives from 16 national endometriosis organizations were involved, including lay support groups, thus generating input from women who suffer from endometriosis. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) The World Endometriosis Society commissioned and hosted the consensus meeting. Financial support for participants to attend the meeting was provided by the organizations that they represented. There was no other specific funding for this consensus process.

This manifold project, Dance Studies in/and the Humanities, receives funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation through 2015 and includes a series of public roundtable discussions. This conversation-abridged from the original event-took place during two such roundtables at Brown University in June 2013, and it features substantial contributions from scholars Michelle Clayton, Mark Franko, Nadine George-Graves, André Lepecki, Susan Manning, Janice Ross, and Rebecca Schneider. Speakers address what dance studies may need, want, or do in this current historical moment. Manning articulates her experience being inside and beside dance studies through teaching in an integrationist/assimilationist model that promotes dance as a subfield in humanities (and occasionally social science) departments. Franko asserts that dance studies formed as a result of an epistemological break in the 1980s and adds that interdisciplinary frameworks can also support this relatively new field. Through embracing the partiality that comes with interdisciplinarity, Clayton encourages participants to investigate generative misunderstandings. Ross provides a comprehensive account of the crisis in the humanities, and Lepecki connects this crisis to the permanent state of war in the U.S. and emphasizes the importance of theory in dance studies. Falling short of Afro-pessimism, George-Graves calls for dance studies to infiltrate the upper echelons of higher education administration, and Schneider articulates post-structuralism's link to the Global South while calling for more scholarly representation from this area of the world. Through exploring possibilities for embodied knowledge, reenacting post-structuralism, and embracing partiality, these scholars address the expanding aperture of dance studies in a global economy. Topics identified for future discussion include decentering the whiteness of dance studies transnationally, exploring how dance studies methodologies are currently utilized in academia, and expanding dance studies beyond the American academy. © 2013 Congress on Research in Dance.","Academia; Afro-pessimism; Agency; Assimilationist; Choreography as research; Choreopolitical; Crisis in humanities; Dance and higher education; Dance and humanities; Dance and theater; Dance and theory; Dance and visual art; Dance dramaturgy; Dance methodology; Dance Studies; Embodied knowledge; Generative misunderstandings; Global South; Graduate dance programs; Higher education administration; Humanism; Integrationist; Interdisciplinarity; Partiality; Pedagogy; Performance studies; Political theory; Post-structuralism; Privilege; Reenactment; Slash; Society of Dance History Scholars; Transnationalism; Undergraduate dance programs; War; Western theater dance; Whiteness; World dance",,,,01497677,,,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897378093

Scientists described accurately pseudo-experiments performed on concentration camp prisoners. A lot of attention was also devoted to criminal practices that led to the death of many patients in psychiatric hospitals. It seems, however, that the subject has never lost its relevance. It should be a base for reflection on the dangers of forgetting the fundamental principles of ethical practice in medicine. The book by Arthur Katolo is another study showing the action of German doctors during World War II. This book, however, deserves more attention because of the author's attempt to show the mechanisms leading to acceptance by the Third Reich society of such activities as forced sterilization of mentally impaired people or ""life extinguishing procedures"" applied to people with disabilities, in particular mental patients.

Objectives: This perspective calls for additional VSM research in key areas including the phenomenology and adverse health and social consequences of acute inhalant intoxication and for prospective longitudinal studies of the natural history of VSM and related deleterious long-term biomedical and psychosocial outcomes. Taxonomic investigations are needed to identify subtypes of volatile substance misusers (VSMs), whereas qualitative and mixed methods evaluations would provide important information about cultural and interpersonal contexts and specific patterns, modalities and agents of VSM. Treatment outcome and health services studies have rarely been conducted with reference to VSMs and are needed. Studies of specific inhalants and high-risk populations for VSM would also contribute to current knowledge regarding VSM and help reduce the toll taken by this prevalent form of drug misuse. Methods: The authors draw on VSM studies that they and other researchers have conducted to exemplify the types of research needed in each of the domains identified above. Results and Conclusions: Despite the global ubiquity of VSM, much remains to be learned about this form of substance use.

People with diabetes have two to five times greater risk of developing CVD as compared with non-diabetic individuals. To date, little information exists on the prevalence and characteristics of cardiovascular risk factors in Kuwait. The objective of this survey was to address the growing burden of diabetes and related cardiovascular risk factors, and to estimate, for the first time, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the State of Kuwait. Methods: The study was carried out using the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach for surveillance of non-communicable disease risk factors. This study represents a national survey for Kuwaiti nationals aged between 20 and 65 years. All participants were involved in an interview for gathering sociodemographic information, underwent focused physical examination and donated a blood sample for the study-specific laboratory investigations. Results: A total of 1970 subjects, with a mean age of 48.9 ± 10.5, were screened. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was as follows: diabetes 17.9%, dyslipidaemia 70.3%, hypertension 25.3% and obesity 48.2%. Over 62% had a sedentary lifestyle, and 17.8% were smokers. The prevalence of diabetes and dyslipidaemia increased with age and body mass index. Diabetes was also significantly associated with age above 40 years (OR = 10.5), family history of diabetes (OR = 2.79), hypertension (OR = 2.22), obesity (OR = 2.87) and lower literacy (OR = 4.23). Conclusions: This study found that advancing age (≥ 40 years), diabetes mellitus, obesity, positive family history of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia are significant risk factors for developing CVD in Kuwait as in other parts of the world. Understanding these factors allows for preventive measures to be taken for Kuwaiti population. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"hemoglobin A1c; adult; aged; article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; communicable disease; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; disease surveillance; dyslipidemia; education; family history; female; glucose intolerance; health care personnel; health care policy; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertension; Kuwait; lipid metabolism; major clinical study; male; obesity; physical activity; physical examination; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sedentary lifestyle; sex difference; smoking; socioeconomics; systolic blood pressure; world health organization; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Body Mass Index; Diabetic Angiopathies; Dyslipidemias; Humans; Hypertension; Kuwait; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sedentary Lifestyle; Sex Distribution; Smoking; Young Adult",,,13685031,,IJCPF,23241053,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871458291

We still do not know enough about the implementation of the policy of dispossession, disfranchisement as well as the changes in the legal system of the postwar socialist Eastern European states. With an institution-based approach the paper examines the practices of expropriation and reallocation in Polish society during the immediate post-war years. Hence we have to deal with a series of developments concerning not only property but also with the treatment of the different groups of inhabitants in general. On this point the article focuses explicitly on the handling of property belonging to Jewish citizens of the interwar Polish republic, who survived the war, as well as the property of former Jewish citizens of the Reich. An important institutional actor in these cases was the Main Office of Liquidation (Główny Urza̧d Likwidacyjny), which had numerous branches all over the country. It was concerned with the transfer of the property of Christian and Jewish Germans to Polish public or private property as well as the securing and return of the stolen property of Polish citizens (Jews and non-Jews). Until now the extensive files of the Main Liquidation Office have not been subjected to systematic research. I intend to demonstrate how legal culture in postwar Poland was influenced by the synchronicity of building a new system on the one hand and coming to terms with the racist legacies of Germany on the other hand. The aim of the article is to ascertain concrete problems at a time of re-defining property rights by nationalizing, retransferring and reallocating different groups of assets. Special attention is given to the economic importance of the Main Office of Liquidation but also to its influence on the legal mindset and the legal culture of a society that had just overcome the brutal Nazi occupation. The political culture in post-war Poland cannot be understood without considering legal practices within the context of total war and revolution.","German-Polish-jewish relations; Legacy of the second world; Legal history; Poland; Property",,,,18993044,,,,"Polish",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883338158

The effects on specific cardiovascular outcome and the role of individual susceptibility are less studied. This paper focuses on the short-term effects of ozone on acute coronary events and it investigates comorbidities as indicators of personal susceptibility. Setting and patients: This study was conducted in five urban areas of the Tuscany region (Italy) covering the period January 2002-December 2005. Air quality and meteorological data from urban background monitoring sites were collected. Hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and out-of-hospital coronary deaths were extracted from administrative database. Design: Both time series and case-crossover designs were applied. The confounding effects of some time-dependent variables, such as temperature, were taken into account. Some potential susceptibility factors were investigated. Pooled estimates were derived from random-effect meta-analysis. Results: During the warm season 4555 hospitalized acute myocardial infarctions and 1931 out-of-hospital coronary deaths occurred. Authors estimated a 6.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.2%, 11.7%) increase in out-of-hospital coronary deaths for a 10μg/m3 increase in ozone (lag0-5). Results also suggested higher risks for females, elderly, and patients previously hospitalized for cerebrovascular and artery diseases. Conclusions: This study adds further evidence to the relation between cardiovascular diseases and ozone exposure, showing an adverse effect on out-of-hospital coronary deaths, but not on hospitalized acute myocardial infarctions.
